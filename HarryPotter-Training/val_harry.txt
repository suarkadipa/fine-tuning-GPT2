Looking extremely apprehensive, Krum moved

forward and squatted down next to Mr. Crouch.

“Just keep him here,” said Harry, pulling himself free

of Mr. Crouch. “I’ll be back with Dumbledore.”

“Hurry, von’t you?” Krum called after him as Harry

sprinted away from the forest and up through the

dark grounds. They were deserted; Bagman, Cedric,

and Fleur had disappeared. Harry tore up the stone

steps, through the oak front doors, and off up the

marble staircase, toward the second floor.

Five minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone

gargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridor.

“Sher — sherbet lemon!” he panted at it.

This was the password to the hidden staircase to

Dumbledore ’s office — or at least, it had been two

years ago. The password had evidently changed,

however, for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life

and jump aside, but stood frozen, glaring at Harry

malevolently.

“Move!” Harry shouted at it. “C’mon!”

But nothing at Hogwarts had ever moved just because

he shouted at it; he knew it was no good. He looked

up and down the dark corridor. Perhaps Dumbledore

was in the staffroom? He started running as fast as

he could toward the staircase —

“POTTER!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry skidded to a halt and looked around. Snape

had just emerged from the hidden staircase behind

the stone gargoyle. The wall was sliding shut behind

him even as he beckoned Harry back toward him.

“What are you doing here, Potter?”

“I need to see Professor Dumbledore!” said Harry,

running back up the corridor and skidding to a

standstill in front of Snape instead. “It’s Mr. Crouch

... he’s just turned up ... he’s in the forest ... he’s

asking — ”

“What is this rubbish?” said Snape, his black eyes

glittering. “What are you talking about?”

“Mr. Crouch!” Harry shouted. “From the Ministry!

He’s ill or something — he’s in the forest, he wants to

see Dumbledore! Just give me the password up to — ”

“The headmaster is busy, Potter,” said Snape, his thin

mouth curling into an unpleasant smile.

“I’ve got to tell Dumbledore!” Harry yelled.

“Didn’t you hear me, Potter?”

Harry could tell Snape was thoroughly enjoying

himself, denying Harry the thing he wanted when he

was so panicky.

“Look,” said Harry angrily, “Crouch isn’t right — he’s

— he’s out of his mind — he says he wants to warn —

The stone wall behind Snape slid open. Dumbledore

was standing there, wearing long green robes and a

mildly curious expression. “Is there a problem?” he

said, looking between Harry and Snape.

 

“Professor!” Harry said, sidestepping Snape before

Snape could speak, “Mr. Crouch is here — he’s down

in the forest, he wants to speak to you!”

Harry expected Dumbledore to ask questions, but to

his relief, Dumbledore did nothing of the sort.

“Lead the way,” he said promptly, and he swept off

along the corridor behind Harry, leaving Snape

standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as

ugly.

“What did Mr. Crouch say, Harry?” said Dumbledore

as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase.

“Said he wants to warn you ... said he’s done

something terrible ... he mentioned his son . . . and

Bertha Jorkins ... and — and Voldemort ... something

about Voldemort getting stronger. ...”

“Indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he quickened his

pace as they hurried out into the pitch-darkness.

“He’s not acting normally,” Harry said, hurrying along

beside Dumbledore. “He doesn’t seem to know where

he is. He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley’s

there, and then he changes, and says he needs to see

you. ... I left him with Viktor Krum.”

“You did?” said Dumbledore sharply, and he began to

take longer strides still, so that Harry was running to

keep up. “Do you know if anybody else saw Mr.

Crouch?”

“No,” said Harry. “Krum and I were talking, Mr.

Bagman had just finished telling us about the third

task, we stayed behind, and then we saw Mr. Crouch

coming out of the forest — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Where are they?” said Dumbledore as the

Beauxbatons carriage emerged from the darkness.

“Over here,” said Harry, moving in front of

Dumbledore, leading the way through the trees. He

couldn’t hear Crouch’s voice anymore, but he knew

where he was going; it hadn’t been much past the

Beauxbatons carriage ... somewhere around here. ...

“Viktor?” Harry shouted.

No one answered.

“They were here,” Harry said to Dumbledore. “They

were definitely somewhere around here. ...”

“Lumos,” Dumbledore said, lighting his wand and

holding it up.

Its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black

trunk, illuminating the ground. And then it fell upon

a pair of feet.

Harry and Dumbledore hurried forward. Krum was

sprawled on the forest floor. He seemed to be

unconscious. There was no sign at all of Mr. Crouch.

Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of

his eyelids.

“Stunned,” he said softly. His half-moon glasses

glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the

surrounding trees.

“Should I go and get someone?” said Harry. “Madam

Pomfrey?”

“No,” said Dumbledore swiftly. “Stay here.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

He raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the

direction of Hagrid ’s cabin. Harry saw something

silvery dart out of it and streak away through the

trees like a ghostly bird. Then Dumbledore bent over

Krum again, pointed his wand at him, and muttered,

“Renneruate.”

Krum opened his eyes. He looked dazed. When he saw

Dumbledore, he tried to sit up, but Dumbledore put a

hand on his shoulder and made him lie still.

“He attacked me!” Krum muttered, putting a hand up

to his head. “The old madman attacked me! I vos

looking around to see vare Potter had gone and he

attacked from behind!”

“Lie still for a moment,” Dumbledore said.

The sound of thunderous footfalls reached them, and

Hagrid came panting into sight with Fang at his

heels. He was carrying his crossbow.

“Professor Dumbledore!” he said, his eyes widening.

“Harry — what the — ?”

“Hagrid, I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff,” said

Dumbledore. “His student has been attacked. When

you’ve done that, kindly alert Professor Moody — ”

“No need, Dumbledore,” said a wheezy growl. “I’m

here.”

Moody was limping toward them, leaning on his staff,

his wand lit.

“Damn leg,” he said furiously. “Would’ve been here

quicker ... what’s happened? Snape said something

about Crouch — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Crouch?” said Hagrid blankly.

“Karkaroff, please, Hagrid!” said Dumbledore sharply.

“Oh yeah ... right y’are, Professor ...” said Hagrid, and

he turned and disappeared into the dark trees, Fang

trotting after him.

“I don’t know where Barty Crouch is,” Dumbledore

told Moody, “but it is essential that we find him.”

“I’m onto it,” growled Moody, and he pulled out his

wand and limped off into the forest.

Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke again until they

heard the unmistakable sounds of Hagrid and Fang

returning. Karkaroff was hurrying along behind them.

He was wearing his sleek silver furs, and he looked

pale and agitated.

“What is this?” he cried when he saw Krum on the

ground and Dumbledore and Harry beside him.

“What’s going on?”

“I vos attacked!” said Krum, sitting up now and

rubbing his head. “Mr. Crouch or votever his name —

“Crouch attacked you? Crouch attacked you? The

Triwizard judge?”

“Igor,” Dumbledore began, but Karkaroff had drawn

himself up, clutching his furs around him, looking

livid.

“Treachery!” he bellowed, pointing at Dumbledore. “It

is a plot! You and your Ministry of Magic have lured

me here under false pretenses, Dumbledore! This is

not an equal competition! First you sneak Potter into

 

the tournament, though he is underage! Now one of

your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion

out of action! I smell double-dealing and corruption in

this whole affair, and you, Dumbledore, you, with

your talk of closer international wizarding links, of

rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences —

here’s what I think of you!”

Karkaroff spat onto the ground at Dumbledore’s feet.

In one swift movement, Hagrid seized the front of

Karkaroff’s furs, lifted him into the air, and slammed

him against a nearby tree.

“Apologize!” Hagrid snarled as Karkaroff gasped for

breath, Hagrid’s massive fist at his throat, his feet

dangling in midair.

“Hagrid, no\” Dumbledore shouted, his eyes flashing.

Hagrid removed the hand pinning Karkaroff to the

tree, and Karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk

and slumped in a huddle at its roots; a few twigs and

leaves showered down upon his head.

“Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle, Hagrid,”

said Dumbledore sharply.

Breathing heavily, Hagrid gave Karkaroff a glowering

look.

“Maybe I’d better stay here, Headmaster. ...”

“You will take Harry back to school, Hagrid,”

Dumbledore repeated firmly. “Take him right up to

Gryffindor Tower. And Harry — I want you to stay

there. Anything you might want to do — any owls you

might want to send — they can wait until morning, do

you understand me?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Er — yes,” said Harry, staring at him. How had

Dumbledore known that, at that very moment, he had

been thinking about sending Pigwidgeon straight to

Sirius, to tell him what had happened?

“Ill leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster,” Hagrid said,

staring menacingly at Karkaroff, who was still

sprawled at the foot of the tree, tangled in furs and

tree roots. “Stay, Fang. C’mon, Harry.”

They marched in silence past the Beauxbatons

carriage and up toward the castle.

“How dare he,” Hagrid growled as they strode past the

lake. “How dare he accuse Dumbledore. Like

Dumbledore ’d do anythin’ like that. Like Dumbledore

wanted you in the tournament in the firs’ place.

Worried! I dunno when I seen Dumbledore more

worried than he’s bin lately. An’ you!” Hagrid

suddenly said angrily to Harry, who looked up at him,

taken aback. “What were yeh doin’, wanderin’ off with

ruddy Krum? He’s from Durmstrang, Harry! Coulda

jinxed yeh right there, couldn’ he? Hasn’ Moody

taught yeh nothin’? ’Magine lettin’ him lure yeh off on

yer own — ”

“Krum’s all right!” said Harry as they climbed the

steps into the entrance hall. “He wasn’t trying to jinx

me, he just wanted to talk about Hermione — ”

“I’ll be havin’ a few words with her, an’ all,” said

Hagrid grimly, stomping up the stairs. “The less you

lot ’ave ter do with these foreigners, the happier yeh’ll

be. Yeh can’ trust any of ’em.”

“You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime,”

Harry said, annoyed.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Don’ you talk ter me abou’ her!” said Hagrid, and he

looked quite frightening for a moment. “I’ve got her

number now! Tryin’ ter get back in me good books,

tryin’ ter get me ter tell her what’s cornin’ in the third

task. Ha! You can’ trust any of ’em!”

Hagrid was in such a bad mood, Harry was quite glad

to say good-bye to him in front of the Fat Lady. He

clambered through the portrait hole into the common

room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron

and Hermione were sitting, to tell them what had

happened.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE DREAM

“It comes down to this,” said Hermione, rubbing her

forehead. “Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or

somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor

wasn’t looking.”

“It must’ve been Crouch,” said Ron at once. “That’s

why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got

there. He’d done a runner.”

“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shaking his head. “He

seemed really weak — I don’t reckon he was up to

Disapparating or anything.”

“You can’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds,

haven’t I told you enough times?” said Hermione.

“Okay ... how’s this for a theory,” said Ron excitedly.

“Krum attacked Crouch — no, wait for it — and then

Stunned himself!”

“And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?” said Hermione

coldly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Oh yeah ...”

It was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept

out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to

the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they

were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All

three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they

had been talking late into the night about Mr.

Crouch.

“Just go through it again, Harry,” said Hermione.

“What did Mr. Crouch actually say?”

“I’ve told you, he wasn’t making much sense,” said

Harry. “He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about

something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins,

and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying

stuff was his fault. ... He mentioned his son.”

“Well, that was his fault,” said Hermione testily.

“He was out of his mind,” said Harry. “Half the time

he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive,

and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving

him instructions.”

“And ... remind me what he said about You-Know-

Who?” said Ron tentatively.

“I’ve told you,” Harry repeated dully. “He said he’s

getting stronger.”

There was a pause. Then Ron said in a falsely

confident voice, “But he was out of his mind, like you

said, so half of it was probably just raving. ...”

“He was sanest when he was trying to talk about

Voldemort,” said Harry, and Ron winced at the sound

of the name. “He was having real trouble stringing

 

two words together, but that was when he seemed to

know where he was, and know what he wanted to do.

He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.”

Harry turned away from the window and stared up

into the rafters. The many perches were half-empty;

every now and then, another owl would swoop in

through one of the windows, returning from its night’s

hunting with a mouse in its beak.

“If Snape hadn’t held me up,” Harry said bitterly, “we

might’ve got there in time. The headmaster is busy,

Potter ... what’s this rubbish, Potter?’ Why couldn’t he

have just got out of the way?”

“Maybe he didn’t want you to get there!” said Ron

quickly. “Maybe — hang on — how fast d’you reckon

he could’ve gotten down to the forest? D’you reckon

he could’ve beaten you and Dumbledore there?”

“Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or

something,” said Harry.

“Wouldn’t put it past him,” Ron muttered.

“We need to see Professor Moody,” said Hermione.

“We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch.”

“If he had the Marauder’s Map on him, it would’ve

been easy,” said Harry.

“Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds,”

said Ron, “because it only shows up to the

boundaries, doesn’t — ”

“Shh!” said Hermione suddenly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery.

Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer

and closer.

“ — that’s blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of

trouble for that — ”

“ — we’ve tried being polite; it’s time to play dirty, like

him. He wouldn’t like the Ministry of Magic knowing

what he did — ”

“I’m telling you, if you put that in writing, it’s

blackmail!”

“Yeah, and you won’t be complaining if we get a nice

fat payoff, will you?”

The Owlery door banged open. Fred and George came

over the threshold, then froze at the sight of Harry,

Ron, and Hermione.

“What’re you doing here?” Ron and Fred said at the

same time.

“Sending a letter,” said Harry and George in unison.

“What, at this time?” said Hermione and Fred.

Fred grinned.

“Fine — we won’t ask you what you’re doing, if you

don’t ask us,” he said.

He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands. Harry

glanced at it, but Fred, whether accidentally or on

purpose, shifted his hand so that the name on it was

covered.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Well, don’t let us hold you up,” Fred said, making a

mock bow and pointing at the door.

Ron didn’t move. “Who’re you blackmailing?” he said.

The grin vanished from Fred’s face. Harry saw George

half glance at Fred, before smiling at Ron.

“Don’t be stupid, I was only joking,” he said easily.

“Didn’t sound like that,” said Ron.

Fred and George looked at each other. Then Fred said

abruptly, “I’ve told you before, Ron, keep your nose

out if you like it the shape it is. Can’t see why you

would, but — ”

“It’s my business if you’re blackmailing someone,”

said Ron. “George’s right, you could end up in serious

trouble for that.”

“Told you, I was joking,” said George. He walked over

to Fred, pulled the letter out of his hands, and began

attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl. “You’re

starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother,

you are, Ron. Carry on like this and you’ll be made a

prefect.”

“No, I won’t!” said Ron hotly.

George carried the barn owl over to the window and it

took off. George turned around and grinned at Ron.

“Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you

later.”

He and Fred left the Owlery. Harry, Ron, and

Hermione stared at one another.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You don’t think they know something about all this,

do you?” Hermione whispered. “About Crouch and

everything?”

“No,” said Harry. “If it was something that serious,

they’d tell someone. They’d tell Dumbledore.”

Ron, however, was looking uncomfortable.

“What’s the matter?” Hermione asked him.

“Well ...” said Ron slowly, “I dunno if they would.

They’re ... they’re obsessed with making money lately,

I noticed it when I was hanging around with them —

when — you know — ”

“We weren’t talking.” Harry finished the sentence for

him. “Yeah, but blackmail ...”

“It’s this joke shop idea they’ve got,” said Ron. “I

thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum, but

they really mean it, they want to start one. They’ve

only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on

about how it’s time to think about their future, and

Dad can’t help them, and they need gold to get

started.”

Hermione was looking uncomfortable now.

“Yes, but ... they wouldn’t do anything against the law

to get gold.”

“Wouldn’t they?” said Ron, looking skeptical. “I dunno

... they don’t exactly mind breaking rules, do they?”

“Yes, but this is the law,” said Hermione, looking

scared. “This isn’t some silly school rule. ... They’ll get

a lot more than detention for blackmail! Ron ... maybe

you’d better tell Percy. ...”

 

“Are you mad?” said Ron. “Tell Percy? He’d probably

do a Crouch and turn them in.” He stared at the

window through which Fred and Georges owl had

departed, then said, “Come on, let’s get some

breakfast.”

“D’you think it’s too early to go and see Professor

Moody?” Hermione said as they went down the spiral

staircase.

“Yes,” said Harry. “He’d probably blast us through the

door if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he’ll think

we’re trying to attack him while he’s asleep. Let’s give

it till break.”

History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly. Harry kept

checking Ron’s watch, having finally discarded his

own, but Ron’s was moving so slowly he could have

sworn it had stopped working too. All three of them

were so tired they could happily have put their heads

down on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn’t

taking her usual notes, but was sitting with her head

on her hand, gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes

out of focus.

When the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the

corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found

Professor Moody leaving it. He looked as tired as they

felt. The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping, giving

his face an even more lopsided appearance than

usual.

“Professor Moody?” Harry called as they made their

way toward him through the crowd.

“Hello, Potter,” growled Moody. His magical eye

followed a couple of passing first years, who sped up,

looking nervous; it rolled into the back of Moody’s

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

head and watched them around the corner before he

spoke again.

“Come in here.”

He stood back to let them into his empty classroom,

limped in after them, and closed the door.

“Did you find him?” Harry asked without preamble.

“Mr. Crouch?”

“No,” said Moody. He moved over to his desk, sat

down, stretched out his wooden leg with a slight

groan, and pulled out his hip flask.

“Did you use the map?” Harry said.

“Of course,” said Moody, taking a swig from his flask.

“Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it

from my office into the forest. He wasn’t anywhere on

there.”

“So he did Disapparate?” said Ron.

“You can’t Disapparate on the grounds, Ron\” said

Hermione. “There are other ways he could have

disappeared, aren’t there, Professor?”

Moody’s magical eye quivered as it rested on

Hermione. “You’re another one who might think about

a career as an Auror,” he told her. “Mind works the

right way, Granger.”

Hermione flushed pink with pleasure.

“Well, he wasn’t invisible,” said Harry. “The map

shows invisible people. He must’ve left the grounds,

then.”

 

“But under his own steam?” said Hermione eagerly,

“or because someone made him?”

“Yeah, someone could’ve — could’ve pulled him onto a

broom and flown off with him, couldn’t they?” said

Ron quickly, looking hopefully at Moody as if he too

wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror.

“We can’t rule out kidnap,” growled Moody.

“So,” said Ron, “d’you reckon he’s somewhere in

Hogsmeade?”

“Could be anywhere,” said Moody, shaking his head.

“Only thing we know for sure is that he’s not here.”

He yawned widely, so that his scars stretched, and

his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing

teeth. Then he said, “Now, Dumbledore’s told me you

three fancy yourselves as investigators, but there’s

nothing you can do for Crouch. The Ministry’ll be

looking for him now, Dumbledore’s notified them.

Potter, you just keep your mind on the third task.”

“What?” said Harry. “Oh yeah ...”

He hadn’t given the maze a single thought since he’d

left it with Krum the previous night.

“Should be right up your street, this one,” said

Moody, looking up at Harry and scratching his

scarred and stubbly chin. “From what Dumbledore’s

said, you’ve managed to get through stuff like this

plenty of times. Broke your way through a series of

obstacles guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone in your first

year, didn’t you?”

“We helped,” Ron said quickly. “Me and Hermione

helped.”

 

Moody grinned.

“Well, help him practice for this one, and I’ll be very

surprised if he doesn’t win,” said Moody. “In the

meantime ... constant vigilance, Potter. Constant

vigilance.” He took another long draw from his hip

flask, and his magical eye swiveled onto the window.

The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible

through it.

“You two,” counseled Moody, his normal eye on Ron

and Hermione, “you stick close to Potter, all right? I’m

keeping an eye on things, but all the same ... you can

never have too many eyes out.”

•k k k

Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning. It

fluttered down beside Harry at the same moment that

a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione, clutching a

copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak. She took the

newspaper, scanned the first few pages, said, “Ha!

She hasn’t got wind of Crouch!” then joined Ron and

Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the

mysterious events of the night before last.

Harry — what do you think you are playing at,

walking off into the forest with Viktor Krum? I want

you to swear, by return owl, that you are not going to

go walking with anyone else at night. There is

somebody highly dangerous at Hogwarts. It is clear to

me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing

Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from

them in the dark. You could have been killed.

Your name didn’t get into the Goblet of Fire by

accident. If someone’s trying to attack you, they’re on

 

their last chance. Stay close to Ron and Hermione, do

not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours, and arm

yourself for the third task. Practice Stunning and

Disarming. A few hexes wouldn’t go amiss either.

There’s nothing you can do about Crouch. Keep your

head down and look after yourself. I’m waiting for your

letter giving me your word you won’t stray out-of-

bounds again.

Sirius

“Who’s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds?”

said Harry in mild indignation as he folded up Sirius’s

letter and put it inside his robes. “After all the stuff he

did at school!”

“He’s worried about you!” said Hermione sharply.

“Just like Moody and Hagrid! So listen to them!”

“No one’s tried to attack me all year,” said Harry. “No

one’s done anything to me at all — ”

“Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire,” said

Hermione. “And they must’ve done that for a reason,

Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they’ve been biding

their time. Maybe this is the task they’re going to get

you.”

“Look,” said Harry impatiently, “let’s say Sirius is

right, and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch.

Well, they would’ve been in the trees near us,

wouldn’t they? But they waited till I was out of the

way until they acted, didn’t they? So it doesn’t look

like I’m their target, does it?”

“They couldn’t have made it look like an accident if

they’d murdered you in the forest!” said Hermione.

“But if you die during a task — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“They didn’t care about attacking Krum, did they?”

said Harry. “Why didn’t they just polish me off at the

same time? They could’ve made it look like Krum and

I had a duel or something.”

“Harry, I don’t understand it either,” said Hermione

desperately. “I just know there are a lot of odd things

going on, and I don’t like it. ... Moody’s right — Sirius

is right — you’ve got to get in training for the third

task, straight away. And you make sure you write

back to Sirius and promise him you’re not going to go

sneaking off alone again.”

The Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting

than when Harry had to stay indoors. For the next

few days he spent all of his free time either in the

library with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or

else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to

practice. Harry was concentrating on the Stunning

Spell, which he had never used before. The trouble

was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on

Ron’s and Hermione ’s part.

“Can’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris?” Ron suggested on

Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the

middle of their Charms classroom, having just been

Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a

row. “Let’s Stun her for a bit. Or you could use

Dobby, Harry, I bet he’d do anything to help you. I’m

not complaining or anything” — he got gingerly to his

feet, rubbing his backside — “but I’m aching all over.

“Well, you keep missing the cushions, don’t you!” said

Hermione impatiently, rearranging the pile of

cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell,

which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. “Just try and fall

backward!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well,

Hermione!” said Ron angrily. “Why don’t you take a

turn?”

“Well, I think Harry’s got it now, anyway,” said

Hermione hastily. “And we don’t have to worry about

Disarming, because he’s been able to do that for ages.

... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes

this evening.”

She looked down the list they had made in the

library.

“I like the look of this one,” she said, “this

Impediment Curse. Should slow down anything that’s

trying to attack you, Harry. We’ll start with that one.”

The bell rang. They hastily shoved the cushions back

into Flitwick’s cupboard and slipped out of the

classroom.

“See you at dinner!” said Hermione, and she set off for

Arithmancy, while Harry and Ron headed toward

North Tower, and Divination. Broad strips of dazzling

gold sunlight fell across the corridor from the high

windows. The sky outside was so brightly blue it

looked as though it had been enameled.

“It’s going to be boiling in Trelawney’s room, she never

puts out that fire,” said Ron as they started up the

staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor.

He was quite right. The dimly lit room was

swelteringly hot. The fumes from the perfumed fire

were heavier than ever. Harry’s head swam as he

made his way over to one of the curtained windows.

While Professor Trelawney was looking the other way,

disentangling her shawl from a lamp, he opened it an

inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair, so

 

that a soft breeze played across his face. It was

extremely comfortable.

“My dears,” said Professor Trelawney, sitting down in

her winged armchair in front of the class and peering

around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes,

“we have almost finished our work on planetary

divination. Today, however, will be an excellent

opportunity to examine the effects of Mars, for he is

placed most interestingly at the present time. If you

will all look this way, I will dim the lights. ...”

She waved her wand and the lamps went out. The fire

was the only source of light now. Professor Trelawney

bent down and lifted, from under her chair, a

miniature model of the solar system, contained within

a glass dome. It was a beautiful thing; each of the

moons glimmered in place around the nine planets

and the fiery sun, all of them hanging in thin air

beneath the glass. Harry watched lazily as Professor

Trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle

Mars was making to Neptune. The heavily perfumed

fumes washed over him, and the breeze from the

window played across his face. He could hear an

insect humming gently somewhere behind the

curtain. His eyelids began to droop. ...

He was riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring

through the clear blue sky toward an old, ivy-covered

house set high on a hillside. Lower and lower they

flew, the wind blowing pleasantly in Harry’s face, until

they reached a dark and broken window in the upper

story of the house and entered. Now they were flying

along a gloomy passageway, to a room at the very end

. . . through the door they went, into a dark room

whose windows were boarded up. ...

Harry had left the owl’s back ... he was watching,

now, as it fluttered across the room, into a chair with

 

its back to him. ... There were two dark shapes on the

floor beside the chair . . . both of them were stirring. . . .

One was a huge snake . . . the other was a man ... a

short, balding man, a man with watery eyes and a

pointed nose ... he was wheezing and sobbing on the

hearth rug. . . .

“You are in luck, Wormtail,” said a cold, high-pitched

voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl

had landed. “You are very fortunate indeed. Your

blunder has not ruined everything. He is dead.”

“My Lord!” gasped the man on the floor. “My Lord, I

am ... 1 am so pleased ... and so sorry. ...”

“Nagini,” said the cold voice, “you are out of luck. 1

will not be feeding Wormtail to you, after all ... but

never mind, never mind . . . there is still Harry Potter.

The snake hissed. Harry could see its tongue

fluttering.

“Now, Wormtail,” said the cold voice, “perhaps one

more little reminder why I will not tolerate another

blunder from you. ...”

“My Lord ... no ... I beg you ...”

The tip of a wand emerged from around the back of

the chair, ft was pointing at Wormtail.

“Crucio\” said the cold voice.

Wormtail screamed, screamed as though every nerve

in his body were on fire, the screaming filled Harry’s

ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain; he

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

was yelling too. ... Voldemort would hear him, would

know he was there. ...

“Harry! Harry\”

Harry opened his eyes. He was lying on the floor of

Professor Trelawney’s room with his hands over his

face. His scar was still burning so badly that his eyes

were watering. The pain had been real. The whole

class was standing around him, and Ron was

kneeling next to him, looking terrified.

“You all right?” he said.

“Of course he isn’t!” said Professor Trelawney, looking

thoroughly excited. Her great eyes loomed over Harry,

gazing at him. “What was it, Potter? A premonition?

An apparition? What did you see?”

“Nothing,” Harry lied. He sat up. He could feel himself

shaking. He couldn’t stop himself from looking

around, into the shadows behind him; Voldemort’s

voice had sounded so close. ...

“You were clutching your scar!” said Professor

Trelawney. “You were rolling on the floor, clutching

your scar! Come now, Potter, I have experience in

these matters!”

Harry looked up at her.

“I need to go to the hospital wing, I think,” he said.

“Bad headache.”

“My dear, you were undoubtedly stimulated by the

extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room!” said

Professor Trelawney “If you leave now, you may lose

the opportunity to see further than you have ever — ”

 

“I don’t want to see anything except a headache cure,”

said Harry.

He stood up. The class backed away. They all looked

unnerved.

“See you later,” Harry muttered to Ron, and he picked

up his bag and headed for the trapdoor, ignoring

Professor Trelawney, who was wearing an expression

of great frustration, as though she had just been

denied a real treat.

When Harry reached the bottom of her stepladder,

however, he did not set off for the hospital wing. He

had no intention whatsoever of going there. Sirius

had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again,

and Harry was going to follow his advice: He was

going straight to Dumbledore’s office. He marched

down the corridors, thinking about what he had seen

in the dream ... it had been as vivid as the one that

had awoken him on Privet Drive. ... He ran over the

details in his mind, trying to make sure he could

remember them. ... He had heard Voldemort accusing

Wormtail of making a blunder ... but the owl had

brought good news, the blunder had been repaired,

somebody was dead ... so Wormtail was not going to

be fed to the snake ... he, Harry, was going to be fed

to it instead. ...

Harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle

guarding the entrance to Dumbledore’s office without

noticing. He blinked, looked around, realized what he

had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of

it. Then he remembered that he didn’t know the

password.

“Sherbet lemon?” he tried tentatively.

The gargoyle did not move.

 

“Okay,” said Harry, staring at it, “Pear Drop. Er —

Licorice Wand. Fizzing Whizbee. Drooble’s Best

Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans ... oh

no, he doesn’t like them, does he? ... oh just open,

can’t you?” he said angrily. “I really need to see him,

it’s urgent!”

The gargoyle remained immovable.

Harry kicked it, achieving nothing but an excruciating

pain in his big toe.

“Chocolate Frog!” he yelled angrily, standing on one

leg. “Sugar Quill! Cockroach Cluster!”

The gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside. Harry

blinked.

“Cockroach Cluster?” he said, amazed. “I was only

joking. ...”

He hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped

onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase, which moved

slowly upward as the doors closed behind him, taking

him up to a polished oak door with a brass door

knocker.

He could hear voices from inside the office. He

stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated,

listening.

“Dumbledore, I’m afraid I don’t see the connection,

don’t see it at all!” It was the voice of the Minister of

Magic, Cornelius Fudge. “Ludo says Bertha’s perfectly

capable of getting herself lost. I agree we would have

expected to have found her by now, but all the same,

we’ve no evidence of foul play, Dumbledore, none at

all. As for her disappearance being linked with Barty

Crouch’s!”

 

“And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch,

Minister?” said Moody’s growling voice.

“I see two possibilities, Alastor,” said Fudge. “Either

Crouch has finally cracked — more than likely, I’m

sure you’ll agree, given his personal history — lost his

mind, and gone wandering off somewhere — ”

“He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case,

Cornelius,” said Dumbledore calmly.

“Or else — well ...” Fudge sounded embarrassed.

“Well, I’ll reserve judgment until after I’ve seen the

place where he was found, but you say it was just

past the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you

know what that woman is?”

“I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and

an excellent dancer,” said Dumbledore quietly.

“Dumbledore, come!” said Fudge angrily. “Don’t you

think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of

Hagrid? They don’t all turn out harmless — if, indeed,

you can call Hagrid harmless, with that monster

fixation he’s got — ”

“I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid,”

said Dumbledore, just as calmly. “I think it possible

that it is you who are prejudiced, Cornelius.”

“Can we wrap up this discussion?” growled Moody.

“Yes, yes, let’s go down to the grounds, then,” said

Fudge impatiently.

“No, it’s not that,” said Moody, “it’s just that Potter

wants a word with you, Dumbledore. He’s just outside

the door.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE PENSIEVE

The door of the office opened.

“Hello, Potter,” said Moody. “Come in, then.”

Harry walked inside. He had been inside

Dumbledore’s office once before; it was a very

beautiful, circular room, lined with pictures of

previous headmasters and headmistresses of

Hogwarts, all of whom were fast asleep, their chests

rising and falling gently.

Cornelius Fudge was standing beside Dumbledore’s

desk, wearing his usual pinstriped cloak and holding

his lime-green bowler hat.

“Harry!” said Fudge jovially, moving forward. “How are

you?”

“Fine,” Harry lied.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“We were just talking about the night when Mr.

Crouch turned up on the grounds,” said Fudge. “It

was you who found him, was it not?”

“Yes,” said Harry. Then, feeling it was pointless to

pretend that he hadn’t overheard what they had been

saying, he added, “I didn’t see Madame Maxime

anywhere, though, and she’d have a job hiding,

wouldn’t she?”

Dumbledore smiled at Harry behind Fudge’s back, his

eyes twinkling.

“Yes, well,” said Fudge, looking embarrassed, “we’re

about to go for a short walk on the grounds, Harry, if

you’ll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your

class — ”

“I wanted to talk to you, Professor,” Harry said

quickly, looking at Dumbledore, who gave him a swift,

searching look.

“Wait here for me, Harry,” he said. “Our examination

of the grounds will not take long.”

They trooped out in silence past him and closed the

door. After a minute or so, Harry heard the clunks of

Moody’s wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor

below. He looked around.

“Hello, Fawkes,” he said.

Fawkes, Professor Dumbledore’s phoenix, was

standing on his golden perch beside the door. The

size of a swan, with magnificent scarlet-and-gold

plumage, he swished his long tail and blinked

benignly at Harry.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Harry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore’s

desk. For several minutes, he sat and watched the old

headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their

frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and

running his fingers over his scar. It had stopped

hurting now.

He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in

Dumbledore’s office, knowing he would shortly be

telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at the

walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged

Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next

to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies

set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he

himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his

second year. The sword had once belonged to Godric

Gryffindor, founder of Harry’s House. He was gazing

at it, remembering how it had come to his aid when

he had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a

patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the

glass case. He looked around for the source of the

light and saw a sliver of silver-white shining brightly

from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door

had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated,

glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the

office, and pulled open the cabinet door.

A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings

around the edge: runes and symbols that Harry did

not recognize. The silvery light was coming from the

basin’s contents, which were like nothing Harry had

ever seen before. He could not tell whether the

substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish

silver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it

became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then,

like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked

like light made liquid — or like wind made solid —

Harry couldn’t make up his mind.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

He wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but

nearly four years’ experience of the magical world told

him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some

unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He

therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his

robes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked

back at the contents of the basin, and prodded them.

The surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began

to swirl very fast.

Harry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet.

The silvery substance had become transparent; it

looked like glass. He looked down into it, expecting to

see the stone bottom of the basin — and saw instead

an enormous room below the surface of the

mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed

to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling.

The room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be

underground, for there were no windows, merely

torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated

the walls of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his

nose was a mere inch away from the glassy

substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches

and wizards were seated around every wall on what

seemed to be benches rising in levels. An empty chair

stood in the very center of the room. There was

something about the chair that gave Harry an

ominous feeling. Chains encircled the arms of it, as

though its occupants were usually tied to it.

Where was this place? It surely wasn’t Hogwarts; he

had never seen a room like that here in the castle.

Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the

bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and

Harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers

at Hogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be waiting

for something; even though he could only see the tops

 

of their hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing

in one direction, and none of them were talking to one

another.

The basin being circular, and the room he was

observing square, Harry could not make out what was

going on in the corners of it. He leaned even closer,

tilting his head, trying to see . . .

The tip of his nose touched the strange substance

into which he was staring.

Dumbledore’s office gave an almighty lurch — Harry

was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the

substance inside the basin —

But his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was

falling through something icy-cold and black; it was

like being sucked into a dark whirlpool —

And suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench

at the end of the room inside the basin, a bench

raised high above the others. He looked up at the

high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular

window through which he had just been staring, but

there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.

Breathing hard and fast, Harry looked around him.

Not one of the witches and wizards in the room (and

there were at least two hundred of them) was looking

at him. Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a

fourteen-year- old boy had just dropped from the

ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to the wizard

next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of

surprise that reverberated around the silent room.

He was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Professor!” Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper.

“I’m sorry — I didn’t mean to — I was just looking at

that basin in your cabinet — I — where are we?”

But Dumbledore didn’t move or speak. He ignored

Harry completely. Like every other wizard on the

benches, he was staring into the far corner of the

room, where there was a door.

Harry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then

around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at

Dumbledore. And then it dawned on him. ...

Once before, Harry had found himself somewhere that

nobody could see or hear him. That time, he had

fallen through a page in an enchanted diary, right

into somebody else’s memory ... and unless he was

very much mistaken, something of the sort had

happened again. ...

Harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then

waved it energetically in front of Dumbledore ’s face.

Dumbledore did not blink, look around at Harry, or

indeed move at all. And that, in Harry’s opinion,

settled the matter. Dumbledore wouldn’t ignore him

like that. He was inside a memory, and this was not

the present-day Dumbledore. Yet it couldn’t be that

long ago . . . the Dumbledore sitting next to him now

was silver-haired, just like the present-day

Dumbledore. But what was this place? What were all

these wizards waiting for?

Harry looked around more carefully. The room, as he

had suspected when observing it from above, was

almost certainly underground — more of a dungeon

than a room, he thought. There was a bleak and

forbidding air about the place; there were no pictures

on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried

rows of benches, rising in levels all around the room,

 

all positioned so that they had a clear view of that

chair with the chains on its arms.

Before Harry could reach any conclusions about the

place in which they were, he heard footsteps. The

door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three

people entered — or at least one man, flanked by two

dementors.

Harry’s insides went cold. The dementors — tall,

hooded creatures whose faces were concealed — were

gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the

room, each grasping one of the man’s arms with their

dead and rotten-looking hands. The man between

them looked as though he was about to faint, and

Harry couldn’t blame him ... he knew the dementors

could not touch him inside a memory, but he

remembered their power only too well. The watching

crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the

man in the chained chair and glided back out of the

room. The door swung shut behind them.

Harry looked down at the man now sitting in the

chair and saw that it was Karkaroff.

Unlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger;

his hair and goatee were black. He was not dressed in

sleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes. He was

shaking. Even as Harry watched, the chains on the

arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked

their way up Karkaroff’s arms, binding him there.

“Igor Karkaroff,” said a curt voice to Harry’s left.

Harry looked around and saw Mr. Crouch standing

up in the middle of the bench beside him. Crouch’s

hair was dark, his face was much less lined, he

looked fit and alert. “You have been brought from

Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

You have given us to understand that you have

important information for us.”

Karkaroff straightened himself as best he could,

tightly bound to the chair.

“I have, sir,” he said, and although his voice was very

scared, Harry could still hear the familiar unctuous

note in it. “I wish to be of use to the Ministry. I wish

to help. I — I know that the Ministry is trying to — to

round up the last of the Dark Lord’s supporters. I am

eager to assist in any way I can. ...”

There was a murmur around the benches. Some of

the wizards and witches were surveying Karkaroff

with interest, others with pronounced mistrust. Then

Harry heard, quite distinctly, from Dumbledore’s

other side, a familiar, growling voice saying, “Filth.”

Harry leaned forward so that he could see past

Dumbledore. Mad-Eye Moody was sitting there —

except that there was a very noticeable difference in

his appearance. He did not have his magical eye, but

two normal ones. Both were looking down upon

Karkaroff, and both were narrowed in intense dislike.

“Crouch is going to let him out,” Moody breathed

quietly to Dumbledore. “He’s done a deal with him.

Took me six months to track him down, and Crouch

is going to let him go if he’s got enough new names.

Let’s hear his information, I say, and throw him

straight back to the dementors.”

Dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through

his long, crooked nose.

“Ah, I was forgetting ... you don’t like the dementors,

do you, Albus?” said Moody with a sardonic smile.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“No,” said Dumbledore calmly, “I’m afraid I don’t. I

have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with

such creatures.”

“But for filth like this ...” Moody said softly.

“You say you have names for us, Karkaroff,” said Mr.

Crouch. “Let us hear them, please.”

“You must understand,” said Karkaroff hurriedly,

“that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named operated always in

the greatest secrecy. . . . He preferred that we — I

mean to say, his supporters — and I regret now, very

deeply, that I ever counted myself among them — ”

“Get on with it,” sneered Moody.

“ — we never knew the names of every one of our

fellows — He alone knew exactly who we all were — ”

“Which was a wise move, wasn’t it, as it prevented

someone like you, Karkaroff, from turning all of them

in,” muttered Moody.

“Yet you say you have some names for us?” said Mr.

Crouch.

“I — I do,” said Karkaroff breathlessly. “And these

were important supporters, mark you. People I saw

with my own eyes doing his bidding. I give this

information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce

him, and am filled with a remorse so deep I can

barely — ”

“These names are?” said Mr. Crouch sharply.

Karkaroff drew a deep breath.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“There was Antonin Dolohov,” he said. “I — I saw him

torture countless Muggles and — and non-supporters

of the Dark Lord.”

“And helped him do it,” murmured Moody.

“We have already apprehended Dolohov,” said

Crouch. “He was caught shortly after yourself.”

“Indeed?” said Karkaroff, his eyes widening. “I — I am

delighted to hear it!”

But he didn’t look it. Harry could tell that this news

had come as a real blow to him. One of his names

was worthless.

“Any others?” said Crouch coldly.

“Why, yes ... there was Rosier,” said Karkaroff

hurriedly. “Evan Rosier.”

“Rosier is dead,” said Crouch. “He was caught shortly

after you were too. He preferred to fight rather than

come quietly and was killed in the struggle.”

“Took a bit of me with him, though,” whispered

Moody to Harry’s right. Harry looked around at him

once more, and saw him indicating the large chunk

out of his nose to Dumbledore.

“No — no more than Rosier deserved!” said Karkaroff,

a real note of panic in his voice now. Harry could see

that he was starting to worry that none of his

information would be of any use to the Ministry.

Karkaroff’s eyes darted toward the door in the corner,

behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood,

waiting.

“Any more?” said Crouch.

 

“Yes!” said Karkaroff. “There was Travers — he helped

murder the McKinnons! Mulciber — he specialized in

the Imperius Curse, forced countless people to do

horrific things! Rookwood, who was a spy, and passed

He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named useful information from

inside the Ministry itself!”

Harry could tell that, this time, Karkaroff had struck

gold. The watching crowd was all murmuring

together.

“Rookwood?” said Mr. Crouch, nodding to a witch

sitting in front of him, who began scribbling upon her

piece of parchment. “Augustus Rookwood of the

Department of Mysteries?”

“The very same,” said Karkaroff eagerly. “I believe he

used a network of well-placed wizards, both inside the

Ministry and out, to collect information — ”

“But Travers and Mulciber we have,” said Mr. Crouch.

“Very well, Karkaroff, if that is all, you will be

returned to Azkaban while we decide — ”

“Not yet!” cried Karkaroff, looking quite desperate.

“Wait, I have more!”

Harry could see him sweating in the torchlight, his

white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his

hair and beard.

“Snape!” he shouted. “Severus Snape!”

“Snape has been cleared by this council,” said Crouch

disdainfully. “He has been vouched for by Albus

Dumbledore.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“No!” shouted Karkaroff, straining at the chains that

bound him to the chair. “I assure you! Severus Snape

is a Death Eater!”

Dumbledore had gotten to his feet.

“I have given evidence already on this matter,” he said

calmly. “Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater.

However, he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort’s

downfall and turned spy for us, at great personal risk.

He is now no more a Death Eater than I am.”

Harry turned to look at Mad-Eye Moody. He was

wearing a look of deep skepticism behind

Dumbledore ’s back.

“Very well, Karkaroff,” Crouch said coldly, “you have

been of assistance. I shall review your case. You will

return to Azkaban in the meantime. ...”

Mr. Crouch’s voice faded. Harry looked around; the

dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of

smoke; everything was fading; he could see only his

own body — all else was swirling darkness. ...

And then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in

a different seat, still on the highest bench, but now to

the left side of Mr. Crouch. The atmosphere seemed

quite different: relaxed, even cheerful. The witches

and wizards all around the walls were talking to one

another, almost as though they were at some sort of

sporting event. Harry noticed a witch halfway up the

rows of benches opposite. She had short blonde hair,

was wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end

of an acid-green quill. It was, unmistakably, a

younger Rita Skeeter. Harry looked around;

Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing

different robes. Mr. Crouch looked more tired and

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

somehow fiercer, gaunter. ... Harry understood. It was

a different memory, a different day ... a different trial.

The door in the corner opened, and Ludo Bagman

walked into the room.

This was not, however, a Ludo Bagman gone to seed,

but a Ludo Bagman who was clearly at the height of

his Quidditch-playing fitness. His nose wasn’t broken

now; he was tall and lean and muscular. Bagman

looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair,

but it did not bind him there as it had bound

Karkaroff, and Bagman, perhaps taking heart from

this, glanced around at the watching crowd, waved at

a couple of them, and managed a small smile.

“Ludo Bagman, you have been brought here in front

of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges

relating to the activities of the Death Eaters,” said Mr.

Crouch. “We have heard the evidence against you,

and are about to reach our verdict. Do you have

anything to add to your testimony before we

pronounce judgment?”

Harry couldn’t believe his ears. Ludo Bagman, a

Death Eater?

“Only,” said Bagman, smiling awkwardly, “well — I

know I’ve been a bit of an idiot — ”

One or two wizards and witches in the surrounding

seats smiled indulgently. Mr. Crouch did not appear

to share their feelings. He was staring down at Ludo

Bagman with an expression of the utmost severity

and dislike.

“You never spoke a truer word, boy,” someone

muttered dryly to Dumbledore behind Harry. He

looked around and saw Moody sitting there again. “If I

 

didn’t know he’d always been dim, I’d have said some

of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain.

“Ludovic Bagman, you were caught passing

information to Lord Voldemort’s supporters,” said Mr.

Crouch. “For this, I suggest a term of imprisonment

in Azkaban lasting no less than — ”

But there was an angry outcry from the surrounding

benches. Several of the witches and wizards around

the walls stood up, shaking their heads, and even

their fists, at Mr. Crouch.

“But I’ve told you, I had no idea!” Bagman called

earnestly over the crowd’s babble, his round blue eyes

widening. “None at all! Old Rookwood was a friend of

my dad’s ... never crossed my mind he was in with

You-Know-Who! I thought I was collecting information

for our side! And Rookwood kept talking about getting

me a job in the Ministry later on ... once my

Quidditch days are over, you know ... I mean, I can’t

keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life,

can I?”

There were titters from the crowd.

“It will be put to the vote,” said Mr. Crouch coldly. He

turned to the right-hand side of the dungeon. “The

jury will please raise their hands ... those in favor of

imprisonment ...”

Harry looked toward the right-hand side of the

dungeon. Not one person raised their hand. Many of

the witches and wizards around the walls began to

clap. One of the witches on the jury stood up.

“Yes?” barked Crouch.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“We’d just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his

splendid performance for England in the Quidditch

match against Turkey last Saturday,” the witch said

breathlessly.

Mr. Crouch looked furious. The dungeon was ringing

with applause now. Bagman got to his feet and

bowed, beaming.

“Despicable,” Mr. Crouch spat at Dumbledore, sitting

down as Bagman walked out of the dungeon.

“Rookwood get him a job indeed. ... The day Ludo

Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the

Ministry. ...”

And the dungeon dissolved again. When it had

returned, Harry looked around. He and Dumbledore

were still sitting beside Mr. Crouch, but the

atmosphere could not have been more different. There

was total silence, broken only by the dry sobs of a

frail, wispy-looking witch in the seat next to Mr.

Crouch. She was clutching a handkerchief to her

mouth with trembling hands. Harry looked up at

Crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer

than ever before. A nerve was twitching in his temple.

“Bring them in,” he said, and his voice echoed

through the silent dungeon.

The door in the corner opened yet again. Six

dementors entered this time, flanking a group of four

people. Harry saw the people in the crowd turn to

look up at Mr. Crouch. A few of them whispered to

one another.

The dementors placed each of the four people in the

four chairs with chained arms that now stood on the

dungeon floor. There was a thickset man who stared

blankly up at Crouch; a thinner and more nervous-

 

looking man, whose eyes were darting around the

crowd; a woman with thick, shining dark hair and

heavily hooded eyes, who was sitting in the chained

chair as though it were a throne; and a boy in his late

teens, who looked nothing short of petrified. He was

shivering, his straw-colored hair all over his face, his

freckled skin milk-white. The wispy little witch beside

Crouch began to rock backward and forward in her

seat, whimpering into her handkerchief.

Crouch stood up. He looked down upon the four in

front of him, and there was pure hatred in his face.

“You have been brought here before the Council of

Magical Law,” he said clearly, “so that we may pass

judgment on you, for a crime so heinous — ”

“Father,” said the boy with the straw-colored hair.

“Father ... please ...”

“ — that we have rarely heard the like of it within this

court,” said Crouch, speaking more loudly, drowning

out his son’s voice. “We have heard the evidence

against you. The four of you stand accused of

capturing an Auror — Frank Longbottom — and

subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him

to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your

exiled master, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named — ”

“Father, I didn’t!” shrieked the boy in chains below. “I

didn’t, I swear it, Father, don’t send me back to the

dementors — ”

“You are further accused,” bellowed Mr. Crouch, “of

using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom’s

wife, when he would not give you information. You

planned to restore He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to

power, and to resume the lives of violence you

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the

jury — ”

“Mother!” screamed the boy below, and the wispy little

witch beside Crouch began to sob, rocking backward

and forward. “Mother, stop him, Mother, I didn’t do it,

it wasn’t me!”

“I now ask the jury,” shouted Mr. Crouch, “to raise

their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes

deserve a life sentence in Azkaban!”

In unison, the witches and wizards along the right-

hand side of the dungeon raised their hands. The

crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for

Bagman, their faces full of savage triumph. The boy

began to scream.

“No! Mother, no! I didn’t do it, I didn’t do it, I didn’t

know! Don’t send me there, don’t let him!”

The dementors were gliding back into the room. The

boys’ three companions rose quietly from their seats;

the woman with the heavy-lidded eyes looked up at

Crouch and called, “The Dark Lord will rise again,

Crouch! Throw us into Azkaban; we will wait! He will

rise again and will come for us, he will reward us

beyond any of his other supporters! We alone were

faithful! We alone tried to find him!”

But the boy was trying to fight off the dementors,

even though Harry could see their cold, draining

power starting to affect him. The crowd was jeering,

some of them on their feet, as the woman swept out of

the dungeon, and the boy continued to struggle.

“I’m your son!” he screamed up at Crouch. “I’m your

son!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You are no son of mine!” bellowed Mr. Crouch, his

eyes bulging suddenly. “I have no son!”

The wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and

slumped in her seat. She had fainted. Crouch

appeared not to have noticed.

“Take them away!” Crouch roared at the dementors,

spit flying from his mouth. “Take them away, and

may they rot there!”

“Father! Father, I wasn’t involved! No! No! Father,

please!”

“I think, Harry, it is time to return to my office,” said

a quiet voice in Harry’s ear.

Harry started. He looked around. Then he looked on

his other side.

There was an Albus Dumbledore sitting on his right,

watching Crouch’s son being dragged away by the

dementors — and there was an Albus Dumbledore on

his left, looking right at him.

“Come,” said the Dumbledore on his left, and he put

his hand under Harry’s elbow. Harry felt himself

rising into the air; the dungeon dissolved around him;

for a moment, all was blackness, and then he felt as

though he had done a slow-motion somersault,

suddenly landing flat on his feet, in what seemed like

the dazzling light of Dumbledore ’s sunlit office. The

stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of

him, and Albus Dumbledore was standing beside

him.

“Professor,” Harry gasped, “I know I shouldn’t’ve — I

didn’t mean — the cabinet door was sort of open and

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“I quite understand,” said Dumbledore. He lifted the

basin, carried it over to his desk, placed it upon the

polished top, and sat down in the chair behind it. He

motioned for Harry to sit down opposite him.

Harry did so, staring at the stone basin. The contents

had returned to their original, silvery-white state,

swirling and rippling beneath his gaze.

“What is it?” Harry asked shakily.

“This? It is called a Pensieve,” said Dumbledore. “I

sometimes find, and I am sure you know the feeling,

that I simply have too many thoughts and memories

crammed into my mind.”

“Er,” said Harry, who couldn’t truthfully say that he

had ever felt anything of the sort.

“At these times,” said Dumbledore, indicating the

stone basin, “I use the Pensieve. One simply siphons

the excess thoughts from one’s mind, pours them into

the basin, and examines them at one’s leisure. It

becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you

understand, when they are in this form.”

“You mean . . . that stuff’s your thoughts?” Harry said,

staring at the swirling white substance in the basin.

“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Let me show you.”

Dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his

robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair,

near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair

seemed to be clinging to it — but then Harry saw that

it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange

silvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve.

Dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin,

and Harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming

 

around the surface of the bowl. Dumbledore placed

his long hands on either side of the Pensieve and

swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for

fragments of gold . . . and Harry saw his own face

change smoothly into Snape’s, who opened his mouth

and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.

“It’s coming back ... Karkaroff’s too ... stronger and

clearer than ever ...”

“A connection I could have made without assistance,”

Dumbledore sighed, “but never mind.” He peered over

the top of his half-moon spectacles at Harry, who was

gaping at Snape’s face, which was continuing to swirl

around the bowl. “I was using the Pensieve when Mr.

Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather

hastily. Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door

properly. Naturally, it would have attracted your

attention.”

“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled.

Dumbledore shook his head. “Curiosity is not a sin,”

he said. “But we should exercise caution with our

curiosity ... yes, indeed ...”

Frowning slightly, he prodded the thoughts within the

basin with the tip of his wand. Instantly, a figure rose

out of it, a plump, scowling girl of about sixteen, who

began to revolve slowly, with her feet still in the basin.

She took no notice whatsoever of Harry or Professor

Dumbledore. When she spoke, her voice echoed as

Snape’s had done, as though it were coming from the

depths of the stone basin. “He put a hex on me,

Professor Dumbledore, and I was only teasing him,

sir. I only said I’d seen him kissing Florence behind

the greenhouses last Thursday. ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“But why, Bertha,” said Dumbledore sadly, looking up

at the now silently revolving girl, “why did you have to

follow him in the first place?”

“Bertha?” Harry whispered, looking up at her. “Is that

— was that Bertha Jorkins?”

“Yes,” said Dumbledore, prodding the thoughts in the

basin again; Bertha sank back into them, and they

became silvery and opaque once more. “That was

Bertha as I remember her at school.”

The silvery light from the Pensieve illuminated

Dumbledore’s face, and it struck Harry suddenly how

very old he was looking. He knew, of course, that

Dumbledore was getting on in years, but somehow he

never really thought of Dumbledore as an old man.

“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Before you got

lost in my thoughts, you wanted to tell me

something.”

“Yes,” said Harry. “Professor — I was in Divination

just now, and — er — I fell asleep.”

He hesitated here, wondering if a reprimand was

coming, but Dumbledore merely said, “Quite

understandable. Continue.”

“Well, I had a dream,” said Harry. “A dream about

Lord Voldemort. He was torturing Wormtail ... you

know who Wormtail — ”

“I do know,” said Dumbledore promptly. “Please

continue.”

“Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said

something like, Wormtail’s blunder had been

repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said,

 

Wormtail wouldn’t be fed to the snake — there was a

snake beside his chair. He said — he said he’d be

feeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus

Curse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt,” Harry said.

“It woke me up, it hurt so badly.”

Dumbledore merely looked at him.

“Er — that’s all,” said Harry.

“I see,” said Dumbledore quietly. “I see. Now, has your

scar hurt at any other time this year, excepting the

time it woke you up over the summer?”

“No, I — how did you know it woke me up over the

summer?” said Harry, astonished.

“You are not Sirius’s only correspondent,” said

Dumbledore. “I have also been in contact with him

ever since he left Hogwarts last year. It was I who

suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place

for him to stay.”

Dumbledore got up and began walking up and down

behind his desk. Every now and then, he placed his

wand tip to his temple, removed another shining

silver thought, and added it to the Pensieve. The

thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that Harry

couldn’t make out anything clearly: It was merely a

blur of color.

“Professor?” he said quietly, after a couple of minutes.

Dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at Harry.

“My apologies,” he said quietly. He sat back down at

his desk.

“D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?”

 

Dumbledore looked very intently at Harry for a

moment, and then said, “I have a theory, no more

than that. ... It is my belief that your scar hurts both

when Lord Voldemort is near you, and when he is

feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred.”

“But ... why?”

“Because you and he are connected by the curse that

failed,” said Dumbledore. “That is no ordinary scar.”

“So you think . . . that dream . . . did it really happen?”

“It is possible,” said Dumbledore. “I would say —

probable. Harry — did you see Voldemort?”

“No,” said Harry. “Just the back of his chair. But —

there wouldn’t have been anything to see, would

there? I mean, he hasn’t got a body, has he? But ...

but then how could he have held the wand?” Harry

said slowly.

“How indeed?” muttered Dumbledore. “How indeed

Neither Dumbledore nor Harry spoke for a while.

Dumbledore was gazing across the room, and, every

now and then, placing his wand tip to his temple and

adding another shining silver thought to the seething

mass within the Pensieve.

“Professor,” Harry said at last, “do you think he’s

getting stronger?”

“Voldemort?” said Dumbledore, looking at Harry over

the Pensieve. It was the characteristic, piercing look

Dumbledore had given him on other occasions, and

always made Harry feel as though Dumbledore were

seeing right through him in a way that even Moody’s

 

magical eye could not. “Once again, Harry, I can only

give you my suspicions.”

Dumbledore sighed again, and he looked older, and

wearier, than ever.

“The years of Voldemort’s ascent to power,” he said,

“were marked with disappearances. Bertha Jorkins

has vanished without a trace in the place where

Voldemort was certainly known to be last. Mr. Crouch

too has disappeared ... within these very grounds.

And there was a third disappearance, one which the

Ministry, I regret to say, do not consider of any

importance, for it concerns a Muggle. His name was

Frank Bryce, he lived in the village where Voldemort’s

father grew up, and he has not been seen since last

August. You see, I read the Muggle newspapers,

unlike most of my Ministry friends.”

Dumbledore looked very seriously at Harry.

“These disappearances seem to me to be linked. The

Ministry disagrees — as you may have heard, while

waiting outside my office.”

Harry nodded. Silence fell between them again,

Dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then.

Harry felt as though he ought to go, but his curiosity

held him in his chair.

“Professor?” he said again.

“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore.

“Er . . . could I ask you about . . . that court thing I was

in ... in the Pensieve?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You could,” said Dumbledore heavily. “I attended it

many times, but some trials come back to me more

clearly than others ... particularly now. ...”

“You know — you know the trial you found me in?

The one with Crouch’s son? Well ... were they talking

about Neville’s parents?”

Dumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look. “Has

Neville never told you why he has been brought up by

his grandmother?” he said.

Harry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how

he could have failed to ask Neville this, in almost four

years of knowing him.

“Yes, they were talking about Neville’s parents,” said

Dumbledore. “His father, Frank, was an Auror just

like Professor Moody. He and his wife were tortured

for information about Voldemort’s whereabouts after

he lost his powers, as you heard.”

“So they’re dead?” said Harry quietly.

“No,” said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness

Harry had never heard there before. “They are insane.

They are both in St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical

Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them,

with his grandmother, during the holidays. They do

not recognize him.”

Harry sat there, horror-struck. He had never known

... never, in four years, bothered to find out ...

“The Longbottoms were very popular,” said

Dumbledore. “The attacks on them came after

Voldemort’s fall from power, just when everyone

thought they were safe. Those attacks caused a wave

of fury such as I have never known. The Ministry was

 

under great pressure to catch those who had done it.

Unfortunately, the Longbottoms’ evidence was —

given their condition — none too reliable.”

“Then Mr. Crouch’s son might not have been

involved?” said Harry slowly.

Dumbledore shook his head.

“As to that, I have no idea.”

Harry sat in silence once more, watching the contents

of the Pensieve swirl. There were two more questions

he was burning to ask . . . but they concerned the guilt

of living people. ...

“Er,” he said, “Mr. Bagman ...”

"... has never been accused of any Dark activity

since,” said Dumbledore calmly.

“Right,” said Harry hastily, staring at the contents of

the Pensieve again, which were swirling more slowly

now that Dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts.

“And ... er ...”

But the Pensieve seemed to be asking his question for

him. Snape’s face was swimming on the surface

again. Dumbledore glanced down into it, and then up

at Harry.

“No more has Professor Snape,” he said.

Harry looked into Dumbledore ’s light blue eyes, and

the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his

mouth before he could stop it.

“What made you think he’d really stopped supporting

Voldemort, Professor?”

 

Dumbledore held Harry’s gaze for a few seconds, and

then said, “That, Harry, is a matter between Professor

Snape and myself.”

Harry knew that the interview was over; Dumbledore

did not look angry, yet there was a finality in his tone

that told Harry it was time to go. He stood up, and so

did Dumbledore.

“Harry,” he said as Harry reached the door. “Please do

not speak about Neville’s parents to anybody else. He

has the right to let people know, when he is ready.”

“Yes, Professor,” said Harry, turning to go.

“And — ”

Harry looked back. Dumbledore was standing over

the Pensieve, his face lit from beneath by its silvery

spots of light, looking older than ever. He stared at

Harry for a moment, and then said, “Good luck with

the third task.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE THIRD TASK

“Dumbledore reckons You- Know- Who’s getting

stronger again as well?” Ron whispered.

Everything Harry had seen in the Pensieve, nearly

everything Dumbledore had told and shown him

afterward, he had now shared with Ron and

Hermione — and, of course, with Sirius, to whom

Harry had sent an owl the moment he had left

Dumbledore’s office. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat

up late in the common room once again that night,

talking it all over until Harry’s mind was reeling, until

he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a

head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have

been a relief to siphon them off.

Ron stared into the common room fire. Harry thought

he saw Ron shiver slightly, even though the evening

was warm.

“And he trusts Snape?” Ron said. “He really trusts

Snape, even though he knows he was a Death Eater?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Yes,” said Harry.

Hermione had not spoken for ten minutes. She was

sitting with her forehead in her hands, staring at her

knees. Harry thought she too looked as though she

could have done with a Pensieve.

“Rita Skeeter,” she muttered finally.

“How can you be worrying about her now?” said Ron,

in utter disbelief.

“I’m not worrying about her,” Hermione said to her

knees. “I’m just thinking ... remember what she said

to me in the Three Broomsticks? ‘I know things about

Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl.’ This

is what she meant, isn’t it? She reported his trial, she

knew he’d passed information to the Death Eaters.

And Winky too, remember ... ‘Ludo Bagman’s a bad

wizard.’ Mr. Crouch would have been furious he got

off, he would have talked about it at home.”

“Yeah, but Bagman didn’t pass information on

purpose, did he?”

Hermione shrugged.

“And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked

Crouch?” Ron said, turning back to Harry.

“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he’s only saying that because

Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.”

“We never thought of her, did we?” said Ron slowly.

“Mind you, she’s definitely got giant blood, and she

doesn’t want to admit it — ”

“Of course she doesn’t,” said Hermione sharply,

looking up. “Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita

 

found out about his mother. Look at Fudge, jumping

to conclusions about her, just because she’s part

giant. Who needs that sort of prejudice? I’d probably

say I had big bones if I knew that’s what I’d get for

telling the truth.”

Hermione looked at her watch. “We haven’t done any

practicing!” she said, looking shocked. “We were going

to do the Impediment Curse! We’ll have to really get

down to it tomorrow! Come on, Harry, you need to get

some sleep.”

Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their

dormitory. As Harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked

over at Neville’s bed. True to his word to Dumbledore,

he had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville’s

parents. As Harry took off his glasses and climbed

into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to

have parents still living but unable to recognize you.

He often got sympathy from strangers for being an

orphan, but as he listened to Neville’s snores, he

thought that Neville deserved it more than he did.

Lying in the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and

hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and

Mrs. Longbottom. ... He remembered the jeers of the

crowd as Crouch’s son and his companions had been

dragged from the court by the dementors. ... He

understood how they had felt. ... Then he

remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy

and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later.

It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the

canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to

Voldemort. ... He was the one who had torn these

families apart, who had ruined all these lives. ...

Ron and Hermione were supposed to be studying for

their exams, which would finish on the day of the

 

third task, but they were putting most of their efforts

into helping Harry prepare.

“Don’t worry about it,” Hermione said shortly when

Harry pointed this out to them and said he didn’t

mind practicing on his own for a while, “at least we’ll

get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts. We’d

never have found out about all these hexes in class.”

“Good training for when we’re all Aurors,” said Ron

excitedly, attempting the Impediment Curse on a

wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it

stop dead in midair.

The mood in the castle as they entered June became

excited and tense again. Everyone was looking

forward to the third task, which would take place a

week before the end of term. Harry was practicing

hexes at every available moment. He felt more

confident about this task than either of the others.

Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly

be, Moody was right: Harry had managed to find his

way past monstrous creatures and enchanted

barriers before now, and this time he had some

notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay

ahead.

Tired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all

over the school, Professor McGonagall had given them

permission to use the empty Transfiguration

classroom at lunchtimes. Harry had soon mastered

the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and

obstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would

enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and

the Four-Point Spell, a useful discovery of Hermione’s

that would make his wand point due north, therefore

enabling him to check whether he was going in the

right direction within the maze. He was still having

trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was

 

supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around

himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione

managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs

Jinx, and Harry wobbled around the room for ten

minutes afterward before she had looked up the

counter-jinx.

“You’re still doing really well, though,” Hermione said

encouragingly, looking down her list and crossing off

those spells they had already learned. “Some of these

are bound to come in handy.”

“Come and look at this,” said Ron, who was standing

by the window. He was staring down onto the

grounds. “What’s Malfoy doing?”

Harry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and

Goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below.

Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout;

both were smirking. Malfoy was holding his hand up

to his mouth and speaking into it.

“He looks like he’s using a walkie-talkie,” said Harry

curiously.

“He can’t be,” said Hermione, “I’ve told you, those

sorts of things don’t work around Hogwarts. Come on,

Harry,” she added briskly, turning away from the

window and moving back into the middle of the room,

“let’s try that Shield Charm again.”

Sirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he

seemed to want to concentrate on getting Harry

through the last task before they concerned

themselves with anything else. He reminded Harry in

every letter that whatever might be going on outside

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry’s responsibility,

nor was it within his power to influence it.

If Voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote,

my priority is to ensure your safety. He cannot hope to

lay hands on you while you are under Dumbledore’s

protection, but all the same, take no risks : Concentrate

on getting through that maze safely, and then we can

turn our attention to other matters.

Harry’s nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth

drew closer, but they were not as bad as those he had

felt before the first and second tasks. For one thing,

he was confident that, this time, he had done

everything in his power to prepare for the task. For

another, this was the final hurdle, and however well

or badly he did, the tournament would at last be over,

which would be an enormous relief.

Breakfast was a very noisy affair at the Gryffindor

table on the morning of the third task. The post owls

appeared, bringing Harry a good-luck card from

Sirius. It was only a piece of parchment, folded over

and bearing a muddy paw print on its front, but

Harry appreciated it all the same. A screech owl

arrived for Hermione, carrying her morning copy of

the Daily Prophet as usual. She unfolded the paper,

glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of

pumpkin juice all over it.

“What?” said Harry and Ron together, staring at her.

“Nothing,” said Hermione quickly, trying to shove the

paper out of sight, but Ron grabbed it. He stared at

the headline and said, “No way. Not today. That old

cow.”

“What?” said Harry. “Rita Skeeter again?”

 

“No,” said Ron, and just like Hermione, he attempted

to push the paper out of sight.

“It’s about me, isn’t it?” said Harry.

“No,” said Ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone.

But before Harry could demand to see the paper,

Draco Malfoy shouted across the Great Hall from the

Slytherin table.

“Hey, Potter! Potteri How’s your head? You feeling all

right? Sure you’re not going to go berserk on us?”

Malfoy was holding a copy of the Daily Prophet too.

Slytherins up and down the table were sniggering,

twisting in their seats to see Harry’s reaction.

“Let me see it,” Harry said to Ron. “Give it here.”

Very reluctantly, Ron handed over the newspaper.

Harry turned it over and found himself staring at his

own picture, beneath the banner headline:

HARRY POTTER

“DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS”

The boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is

unstable and possibly dangerous, writes Rita Skeeter,

Special Correspondent. Alarming evidence has

recently come to light about Harry Potter’s strange

behavior, which casts doubts upon his suitability to

compete in a demanding competition like the Triwizard

Tournament, or even to attend Hogwarts School.

Potter, the Daily Prophet can exclusively reveal,

regularly collapses at school, and is often heard to

complain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic of the

 

curse with which You-Know-Who attempted to kill him).

On Monday last, midway through a Divination lesson,

your Daily Prophet reporter witnessed Potter storming

from the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too

badly to continue studying.

It is possible, say top experts at St. Mungo’s Hospital

for Magical Maladies and Injuries, that Potter’s brain

was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by You-

Know-Who, and that his insistence that the scar is

still hurting is an expression of his deep-seated

confusion.

“He might even be pretending,” said one specialist.

“This could be a plea for attention.”

The Daily Prophet, however, has unearthed worrying

facts about Harry Potter thatAlbus Dumbledore,

Headmaster of Hogwarts, has carefully concealed from

the wizarding public.

“Potter can speak Parseltongue, ” reveals Draco Malfoy,

a Hogwarts fourth year. “There were a lot of attacks

on students a couple of years ago, and most people

thought Potter was behind them after they saw him

lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on

another boy. It was all hushed up, though. But he’s

made friends with werewolves and giants too. We

think he’d do anything for a bit of power.”

Parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has

long been considered a Dark Art. Indeed, the most

famous Parselmouth of our times is none other than

You-Know-Who himself. A member of the Dark Force

Defense League, who wished to remain unnamed,

stated that he would regard any wizard who could

speak Parseltongue “as worthy of investigation.

Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody

who could converse with snakes, as serpents are

 

often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic, and are

historically associated with evildoers.” Similarly,

“anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious

creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to

have a fondness for violence.”

Albus Dumbledore should surely consider whether a

boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the

Triwizard Tournament. Some fear that Potter might

resort to the Dark Arts in his desperation to win the

tournament, the third task of which takes place this

evening.

“Gone off me a bit, hasn’t she?” said Harry lightly,

folding up the paper.

Over at the Slytherin table, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle

were laughing at him, tapping their heads with their

fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling

their tongues like snakes.

“How did she know your scar hurt in Divination?”

Ron said. “There’s no way she was there, there’s no

way she could’ve heard — ”

“The window was open,” said Harry. “I opened it to

breathe.”

“You were at the top of North Tower!” Hermione said.

“Your voice couldn’t have carried all the way down to

the grounds!”

“Well, you’re the one who’s supposed to be

researching magical methods of bugging!” said Harry.

“You tell me how she did it!”

“I’ve been trying!” said Hermione. “But I ... but ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

An odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over

Hermione ’s face. She slowly raised a hand and ran

her fingers through her hair.

“Are you all right?” said Ron, frowning at her.

“Yes,” said Hermione breathlessly. She ran her fingers

through her hair again, and then held her hand up to

her mouth, as though speaking into an invisible

walkie-talkie. Harry and Ron stared at each other.

“I’ve had an idea,” Hermione said, gazing into space.

“I think I know . . . because then no one would be able

to see ... even Moody ... and she’d have been able to

get onto the window ledge ... but she’s not allowed ...

she’s definitely not allowed ... I think we’ve got her!

Just give me two seconds in the library — just to

make sure!”

With that, Hermione seized her school bag and

dashed out of the Great Hall.

“Oi!” Ron called after her. “We’ve got our History of

Magic exam in ten minutes! Blimey,” he said, turning

back to Harry, “she must really hate that Skeeter

woman to risk missing the start of an exam. What’re

you going to do in Binns’s class — read again?”

Exempt from the end-of-term tests as a Triwizard

champion, Harry had been sitting in the back of every

exam class so far, looking up fresh hexes for the third

task.

“S’pose so,” Harry said to Ron; but just then,

Professor McGonagall came walking alongside the

Gryffindor table toward him.

“Potter, the champions are congregating in the

chamber off the Hall after breakfast,” she said.

 

“But the task’s not till tonight!” said Harry,

accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front,

afraid he had mistaken the time.

“I’m aware of that, Potter,” she said. “The champions’

families are invited to watch the final task, you know.

This is simply a chance for you to greet them.”

She moved away. Harry gaped after her.

“She doesn’t expect the Dursleys to turn up, does

she?” he asked Ron blankly.

“Dunno,” said Ron. “Harry, I’d better hurry, I’m going

to be late for Binns. See you later.”

Harry finished his breakfast in the emptying Great

Hall. He saw Fleur Delacour get up from the

Ravenclaw table and join Cedric as he crossed to the

side chamber and entered. Krum slouched off to join

them shortly afterward. Harry stayed where he was.

He really didn’t want to go into the chamber. He had

no family — no family who would turn up to see him

risk his life, anyway. But just as he was getting up,

thinking that he might as well go up to the library

and do a spot more hex research, the door of the side

chamber opened, and Cedric stuck his head out.

“Harry, come on, they’re waiting for you!”

Utterly perplexed, Harry got up. The Dursleys

couldn’t possibly be here, could they? He walked

across the Hall and opened the door into the

chamber.

Cedric and his parents were just inside the door.

Viktor Krum was over in a corner, conversing with his

dark-haired mother and father in rapid Bulgarian. He

had inherited his father’s hooked nose. On the other

 

side of the room, Fleur was jabbering away in French

to her mother. Fleur’s little sister, Gabrielle, was

holding her mother’s hand. She waved at Harry, who

waved back, grinning. Then he saw Mrs. Weasley and

Bill standing in front of the fireplace, beaming at him.

“Surprise!” Mrs. Weasley said excitedly as he smiled

broadly and walked over to them. “Thought we’d come

and watch you, Harry!” She bent down and kissed

him on the cheek.

“You all right?” said Bill, grinning at Harry and

shaking his hand. “Charlie wanted to come, but he

couldn’t get time off. He said you were incredible

against the Horntail.”

Fleur Delacour, Harry noticed, was eyeing Bill with

great interest over her mother’s shoulder. Harry could

tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or

earrings with fangs on them.

“This is really nice of you,” Harry muttered to Mrs.

Weasley. “I thought for a moment — the Dursleys — ”

“Hmm,” said Mrs. Weasley, pursing her lips. She had

always refrained from criticizing the Dursleys in front

of Harry, but her eyes flashed every time they were

mentioned.

“It’s great being back here,” said Bill, looking around

the chamber (Violet, the Fat Lady’s friend, winked at

him from her frame). “Haven’t seen this place for five

years. Is that picture of the mad knight still around?

Sir Cadogan?”

“Oh yeah,” said Harry, who had met Sir Cadogan the

previous year.

“And the Fat Lady?” said Bill.

 

“She was here in my time,” said Mrs. Weasley. “She

gave me such a telling off one night when I got back

to the dormitory at four in the morning — ”

“What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in

the morning?” said Bill, surveying his mother with

amazement.

Mrs. Weasley grinned, her eyes twinkling.

“Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll,”

she said. “He got caught by Apollyon Pringle — he

was the caretaker in those days — your father’s still

got the marks.”

“Fancy giving us a tour, Harry?” said Bill.

“Yeah, okay,” said Harry, and they made their way

back toward the door into the Great Hall. As they

passed Amos Diggory, he looked around.

“There you are, are you?” he said, looking Harry up

and down. “Bet you’re not feeling quite as full of

yourself now Cedric’s caught you up on points, are

you?”

“What?” said Harry.

“Ignore him,” said Cedric in a low voice to Harry,

frowning after his father. “He’s been angry ever since

Rita Skeeter’s article about the Triwizard Tournament

— you know, when she made out you were the only

Hogwarts champion.”

“Didn’t bother to correct her, though, did he?” said

Amos Diggory, loudly enough for Harry to hear as he

started to walk out of the door with Mrs. Weasley and

Bill. “Still ... you’ll show him, Ced. Beaten him once

before, haven’t you?”

 

“Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble,

Amos!” Mrs. Weasley said angrily. “I would have

thought you’d know that, working at the Ministry!”

Mr. Diggory looked as though he was going to say

something angry, but his wife laid a hand on his arm,

and he merely shrugged and turned away.

Harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the

sunny grounds with Bill and Mrs. Weasley, showing

them the Beauxbatons carriage and the Durmstrang

ship. Mrs. Weasley was intrigued by the Whomping

Willow, which had been planted after she had left

school, and reminisced at length about the

gamekeeper before Hagrid, a man called Ogg.

“How’s Percy?” Harry asked as they walked around

the greenhouses.

“Not good,” said Bill.

“He’s very upset,” said Mrs. Weasley, lowering her

voice and glancing around. “The Ministry wants to

keep Mr. Crouch’s disappearance quiet, but Percy’s

been hauled in for questioning about the instructions

Mr. Crouch has been sending in. They seem to think

there’s a chance they weren’t genuinely written by

him. Percy’s been under a lot of strain. They’re not

letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge

tonight. Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it.”

They returned to the castle for lunch.

“Mum — Bill!” said Ron, looking stunned, as he

joined the Gryffindor table. “What ’re you doing here?”

“Come to watch Harry in the last task!” said Mrs.

Weasley brightly. “I must say, it makes a lovely

change, not having to cook. How was your exam?”

 

“Oh ... okay,” said Ron. “Couldn’t remember all the

goblin rebels’ names, so I invented a few. It’s all

right,” he said, helping himself to a Cornish pasty,

while Mrs. Weasley looked stern, “they’re all called

stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it

wasn’t hard.”

Fred, George, and Ginny came to sit next to them too,

and Harry was having such a good time he felt almost

as though he were back at the Burrow; he had

forgotten to worry about that evening’s task, and not

until Hermione turned up, halfway through lunch,

did he remember that she had had a brainwave about

Rita Skeeter.

“Are you going to tell us — ?”

Hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at

Mrs. Weasley.

“Hello, Hermione,” said Mrs. Weasley, much more

stiffly than usual.

“Hello,” said Hermione, her smile faltering at the cold

expression on Mrs. Weasley’s face.

Harry looked between them, then said, “Mrs. Weasley,

you didn’t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in

Witch Weekly, did you? Because Hermione ’s not my

girlfriend.”

“Oh!” said Mrs. Weasley. “No — of course I didn’t!”

But she became considerably warmer toward

Hermione after that.

Harry, Bill, and Mrs. Weasley whiled away the

afternoon with a long walk around the castle, and

then returned to the Great Hall for the evening feast.

 

Ludo Bagman and Cornelius Fudge had joined the

staff table now. Bagman looked quite cheerful, but

Cornelius Fudge, who was sitting next to Madame

Maxime, looked stern and was not talking. Madame

Maxime was concentrating on her plate, and Harry

thought her eyes looked red. Hagrid kept glancing

along the table at her.

There were more courses than usual, but Harry, who

was starting to feel really nervous now, didn’t eat

much. As the enchanted ceiling overhead began to

fade from blue to a dusky purple, Dumbledore rose to

his feet at the staff table, and silence fell.

“Ladies and gentlemen, in five minutes’ time, I will be

asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch

field for the third and final task of the Triwizard

Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr.

Bagman down to the stadium now.”

Harry got up. The Gryffindors all along the table were

applauding him; the Weasleys and Hermione all

wished him good luck, and he headed off out of the

Great Hall with Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor.

“Feeling all right, Harry?” Bagman asked as they went

down the stone steps onto the grounds. “Confident?”

“I’m okay,” said Harry. It was sort of true; he was

nervous, but he kept running over all the hexes and

spells he had been practicing in his mind as they

walked, and the knowledge that he could remember

them all made him feel better.

They walked onto the Quidditch field, which was now

completely unrecognizable. A twenty-foot-high hedge

ran all the way around the edge of it. There was a gap

right in front of them: the entrance to the vast maze.

The passage beyond it looked dark and creepy.

 

Five minutes later, the stands had begun to fill; the

air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet

as the hundreds of students filed into their seats. The

sky was a deep, clear blue now, and the first stars

were starting to appear. Hagrid, Professor Moody,

Professor McGonagall, and Professor Flitwick came

walking into the stadium and approached Bagman

and the champions. They were wearing large, red,

luminous stars on their hats, all except Hagrid, who

had his on the back of his moleskin vest.

“We are going to be patrolling the outside of the

maze,” said Professor McGonagall to the champions.

“If you get into difficulty, and wish to be rescued,

send red sparks into the air, and one of us will come

and get you, do you understand?”

The champions nodded.

“Off you go, then!” said Bagman brightly to the four

patrollers.

“Good luck, Harry,” Hagrid whispered, and the four of

them walked away in different directions, to station

themselves around the maze. Bagman now pointed

his wand at his throat, muttered, “ Sonorus,” and his

magically magnified voice echoed into the stands.

“Ladies and gentlemen, the third and final task of the

Triwizard Tournament is about to begin! Let me

remind you how the points currently stand! Tied in

first place, with eighty-five points each — Mr. Cedric

Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts

School!” The cheers and applause sent birds from the

Forbidden Forest fluttering into the darkening sky.

“In second place, with eighty points — Mr. Viktor

Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!” More applause. “And

in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons

Academy!”

 

Harry could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron,

and Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up

the stands. He waved up at them, and they waved

back, beaming at him.

“So ... on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said

Bagman. “Three — two — one — ”

He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and

Cedric hurried forward into the maze.

The towering hedges cast black shadows across the

path, and, whether because they were so tall and

thick or because they had been enchanted, the sound

of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment

they entered the maze. Harry felt almost as though he

were underwater again. He pulled out his wand,

muttered, “Lumos,” and heard Cedric do the same

just behind him.

After about fifty yards, they reached a fork. They

looked at each other.

“See you,” Harry said, and he took the left one, while

Cedric took the right.

Harry heard Bagman’s whistle for the second time.

Krum had entered the maze. Harry sped up. His

chosen path seemed completely deserted. He turned

right, and hurried on, holding his wand high over his

head, trying to see as far ahead as possible. Still,

there was nothing in sight.

Bagman’s whistle blew in the distance for the third

time. All of the champions were now inside.

Harry kept looking behind him. The old feeling that

he was being watched was upon him. The maze was

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

growing darker with every passing minute as the sky

overhead deepened to navy. He reached a second fork.

“ Point Me,” he whispered to his wand, holding it flat in

his palm.

The wand spun around once and pointed toward his

right, into solid hedge. That way was north, and he

knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of

the maze. The best he could do was to take the left

fork and go right again as soon as possible.

The path ahead was empty too, and when Harry

reached a right turn and took it, he again found his

way unblocked. Harry didn’t know why, but the lack

of obstacles was unnerving him. Surely he should

have met something by now? It felt as though the

maze were luring him into a false sense of security.

Then he heard movement right behind him. He held

out his wand, ready to attack, but its beam fell only

upon Cedric, who had just hurried out of a path on

the right-hand side. Cedric looked severely shaken.

The sleeve of his robe was smoking.

“Hagrid’s Blast-Ended Skrewts!” he hissed. “They’re

enormous — I only just got away!”

He shook his head and dived out of sight, along

another path. Keen to put plenty of distance between

himself and the skrewts, Harry hurried off again.

Then, as he turned a corner, he saw ... a dementor

gliding toward him. Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by

its hood, its rotting, scabbed hands outstretched, it

advanced, sensing its way blindly toward him. Harry

could hear its rattling breath; he felt clammy coldness

stealing over him, but knew what he had to do. ...

He summoned the happiest thought he could,

concentrated with all his might on the thought of

 

getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and

Hermione, raised his wand, and cried, “Expecto

Patronum).”

A silver stag erupted from the end of Harry’s wand

and galloped toward the dementor, which fell back

and tripped over the hem of its robes. ... Harry had

never seen a dementor stumble.

“Hang on!” he shouted, advancing in the wake of his

silver Patronus. “You’re a boggart! Riddikulusl”

There was a loud crack, and the shape-shifter

exploded in a wisp of smoke. The silver stag faded

from sight. Harry wished it could have stayed, he

could have used some company . . . but he moved on,

quickly and quietly as possible, listening hard, his

wand held high once more.

Left . . . right . . . left again . . . Twice he found himself

facing dead ends. He did the Four-Point Spell again

and found that he was going too far east. He turned

back, took a right turn, and saw an odd golden mist

floating ahead of him.

Harry approached it cautiously, pointing the wand’s

beam at it. This looked like some kind of

enchantment. He wondered whether he might be able

to blast it out of the way.

“Reductol” he said.

The spell shot straight through the mist, leaving it

intact. He supposed he should have known better; the

Reductor Curse was for solid objects. What would

happen if he walked through the mist? Was it worth

chancing it, or should he double back?

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

He was still hesitating when a scream shattered the

silence.

“Fleur?” Harry yelled.

There was silence. He stared all around him. What

had happened to her? Her scream seemed to have

come from somewhere ahead. He took a deep breath

and ran through the enchanted mist.

The world turned upside down. Harry was hanging

from the ground, with his hair on end, his glasses

dangling off his nose, threatening to fall into the

bottomless sky. He clutched them to the end of his

nose and hung there, terrified. It felt as though his

feet were glued to the grass, which had now become

the ceiling. Below him the dark, star-spangled

heavens stretched endlessly. He felt as though if he

tried to move one of his feet, he would fall away from

the earth completely.

Think , he told himself, as all the blood rushed to his

head, think ...

But not one of the spells he had practiced had been

designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and

sky. Did he dare move his foot? He could hear the

blood pounding in his ears. He had two choices — try

and move, or send up red sparks, and get rescued

and disqualified from the task.

He shut his eyes, so he wouldn’t be able to see the

view of endless space below him, and pulled his right

foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling.

Immediately, the world righted itself. Harry fell

forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid

ground. He felt temporarily limp with shock. He took

a deep, steadying breath, then got up again and

 

hurried forward, looking back over his shoulder as he

ran away from the golden mist, which twinkled

innocently at him in the moonlight.

He paused at a junction of two paths and looked

around for some sign of Fleur. He was sure it had

been she who had screamed. What had she met? Was

she all right? There was no sign of red sparks — did

that mean she had got herself out of trouble, or was

she in such trouble that she couldn’t reach her

wand? Harry took the right fork with a feeling of

increasing unease ... but at the same time, he

couldn’t help thinking, One champion down ...

The cup was somewhere close by, and it sounded as

though Fleur was no longer in the running. He’d got

this far, hadn’t he? What if he actually managed to

win? Fleetingly, and for the first time since he’d found

himself champion, he saw again that image of

himself, raising the Triwizard Cup in front of the rest

of the school. ...

He met nothing for ten minutes, but kept running

into dead ends. Twice he took the same wrong

turning. Finally, he found a new route and started to

jog along it, his wandlight waving, making his shadow

flicker and distort on the hedge walls. Then he

rounded another corner and found himself facing a

Blast-Ended Skrewt.

Cedric was right — it was enormous. Ten feet long, it

looked more like a giant scorpion than anything. Its

long sting was curled over its back. Its thick armor

glinted in the light from Harry’s wand, which he

pointed at it.

“Stupefy'.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

The spell hit the skrewt’s armor and rebounded;

Harry ducked just in time, but could smell burning

hair; it had singed the top of his head. The skrewt

issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward

toward him.

“ Impedimental ” Harry yelled. The spell hit the skrewt’s

armor again and ricocheted off; Harry staggered back

a few paces and fell over. a IMPEDIMENT A\”

The skrewt was inches from him when it froze — he

had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell-less

underside. Panting, Harry pushed himself away from

it and ran, hard, in the opposite direction — the

Impediment Curse was not permanent; the skrewt

would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment.

He took a left path and hit a dead end, a right, and

hit another; forcing himself to stop, heart hammering,

he performed the Four-Point Spell again,

backtracked, and chose a path that would take him

northwest.

He had been hurrying along the new path for a few

minutes, when he heard something in the path

running parallel to his own that made him stop dead.

“What are you doing?” yelled Cedric’s voice. “What the

hell d’you think you’re doing?”

And then Harry heard Krum’s voice.

“ Crucio \ ”

The air was suddenly full of Cedric’s yells. Horrified,

Harry began sprinting up his path, trying to find a

way into Cedric’s. When none appeared, he tried the

Reductor Curse again. It wasn’t very effective, but it

burned a small hole in the hedge through which

 

Harry forced his leg, kicking at the thick brambles

and branches until they broke and made an opening;

he struggled through it, tearing his robes, and looking

to his right, saw Cedric jerking and twitching on the

ground, Krum standing over him.

Harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at

Krum just as Krum looked up. Krum turned and

began to run.

“ Stupefy]” Harry yelled.

The spell hit Krum in the back; he stopped dead in

his tracks, fell forward, and lay motionless, facedown

in the grass. Harry dashed over to Cedric, who had

stopped twitching and was lying there panting, his

hands over his face.

“Are you all right?” Harry said roughly, grabbing

Cedric’s arm.

“Yeah,” panted Cedric. “Yeah ... I don’t believe it ... he

crept up behind me. ... I heard him, I turned around,

and he had his wand on me. ...”

Cedric got up. He was still shaking. He and Harry

looked down at Krum.

“I can’t believe this ... I thought he was all right,”

Harry said, staring at Krum.

“So did I,” said Cedric.

“Did you hear Fleur scream earlier?” said Harry.

“Yeah,” said Cedric. “You don’t think Krum got her

too?”

“I don’t know,” said Harry slowly.

 

“Should we leave him here?” Cedric muttered.

“No,” said Harry. “I reckon we should send up red

sparks. Someone’ll come and collect him ... otherwise

he’ll probably be eaten by a skrewt.”

“He’d deserve it,” Cedric muttered, but all the same,

he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks

into the air, which hovered high above Krum, marking

the spot where he lay.

Harry and Cedric stood there in the darkness for a

moment, looking around them. Then Cedric said,

“Well ... I s’pose we’d better go on . ...”

“What?” said Harry. “Oh ... yeah ... right ...”

It was an odd moment. He and Cedric had been

briefly united against Krum — now the fact that they

were opponents came back to Harry. The two of them

proceeded up the dark path without speaking, then

Harry turned left, and Cedric right. Cedric’s footsteps

soon died away.

Harry moved on, continuing to use the Four-Point

Spell, making sure he was moving in the right

direction. It was between him and Cedric now. His

desire to reach the cup first was now burning

stronger than ever, but he could hardly believe what

he’d just seen Krum do. The use of an Unforgivable

Curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in

Azkaban, that was what Moody had told them. Krum

surely couldn’t have wanted the Triwizard Cup that

badly. ... Harry sped up.

Every so often he hit more dead ends, but the

increasing darkness made him feel sure he was

getting near the heart of the maze. Then, as he strode

down a long, straight path, he saw movement once

 

again, and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary

creature, one which he had only seen in picture form,

in his Monster Book of Monsters.

It was a sphinx. It had the body of an over-large lion:

great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in

a brown tuft. Its head, however, was that of a woman.

She turned her long, almond-shaped eyes upon Harry

as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating.

She was not crouching as if to spring, but pacing

from side to side of the path, blocking his progress.

Then she spoke, in a deep, hoarse voice.

“You are very near your goal. The quickest way is past

me.”

“So ... so will you move, please?” said Harry, knowing

what the answer was going to be.

“No,” she said, continuing to pace. “Not unless you

can answer my riddle. Answer on your first guess — I

let you pass. Answer wrongly — I attack. Remain

silent — I will let you walk away from me unscathed.”

Harry’s stomach slipped several notches. It was

Hermione who was good at this sort of thing, not him.

He weighed his chances. If the riddle was too hard, he

could keep silent, get away from the sphinx

unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to

the center.

“Okay,” he said. “Can I hear the riddle?”

The sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very

middle of the path, and recited:

“First think of the person who lives in disguise,

Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies.

 

Next, tell me what’s always the last thing to mend,

The middle of middle and end of the end?

And finally give me the sound often heard

During the search for a hard-to-find word.

Now string them together, and answer me this,

Which creature would you be unwilling to kiss?”

Harry gaped at her.

“Could I have it again . . . more slowly?” he asked

tentatively.

She blinked at him, smiled, and repeated the poem.

“All the clues add up to a creature I wouldn’t want to

kiss?” Harry asked.

She merely smiled her mysterious smile. Harry took

that for a “yes.” Harry cast his mind around. There

were plenty of animals he wouldn’t want to kiss; his

immediate thought was a Blast-Ended Skrewt, but

something told him that wasn’t the answer. He’d have

to try and work out the clues. ...

“A person in disguise,” Harry muttered, staring at her,

“who lies ... er ... that’d be a — an imposter. No,

that’s not my guess! A — a spy? I’ll come back to that

. . . could you give me the next clue again, please?”

She repeated the next lines of the poem.

“ The last thing to mend,’ ” Harry repeated. “Er ... no

idea ... ‘middle of middle’ ... could I have the last bit

again?”

 

She gave him the last four lines.

“ The sound often heard during the search for a hard-

to-find word,’ ” said Harry. “Er ... that’d be ... er ...

hang on — ‘er’! Er’s a sound!”

The sphinx smiled at him.

“Spy ... er ... spy ... er ...” said Harry, pacing up and

down. “A creature I wouldn’t want to kiss ... a spiderl”

The sphinx smiled more broadly. She got up,

stretched her front legs, and then moved aside for

him to pass.

“Thanks!” said Harry, and, amazed at his own

brilliance, he dashed forward.

He had to be close now, he had to be. ... His wand

was telling him he was bang on course; as long as he

didn’t meet anything too horrible, he might have a

chance. ...

Harry broke into a run. He had a choice of paths up

ahead. “Point Mel” he whispered again to his wand,

and it spun around and pointed him to the right-

hand one. He dashed up this one and saw light

ahead.

The Triwizard Cup was gleaming on a plinth a

hundred yards away. Suddenly a dark figure hurtled

out onto the path in front of him.

Cedric was going to get there first. Cedric was

sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup, and

Harry knew he would never catch up, Cedric was

much taller, had much longer legs —

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Then Harry saw something immense over a hedge to

his left, moving quickly along a path that intersected

with his own; it was moving so fast Cedric was about

to run into it, and Cedric, his eyes on the cup, had

not seen it —

“Cedric!” Harry bellowed. “On your left!”

Cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past

the thing and avoid colliding with it, but in his haste,

he tripped. Harry saw Cedric’s wand fly out of his

hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and

began to bear down upon Cedric.

“Stupefy'.” Harry yelled; the spell hit the spider’s

gigantic, hairy black body, but for all the good it did,

he might as well have thrown a stone at it; the spider

jerked, scuttled around, and ran at Harry instead.

“ Stupefy ! Impedimenta ! Stupefy !”

But it was no use — the spider was either so large, or

so magical, that the spells were doing no more than

aggravating it. Harry had one horrifying glimpse of

eight shining black eyes and razor-sharp pincers

before it was upon him.

He was lifted into the air in its front legs; struggling

madly, he tried to kick it; his leg connected with the

pincers and next moment he was in excruciating

pain. He could hear Cedric yelling “Stupefy'.” too, but

his spell had no more effect than Harry’s — Harry

raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once

more and shouted “ Expelliarmus'.”

It worked — the Disarming Spell made the spider

drop him, but that meant that Harry fell twelve feet

onto his already injured leg, which crumpled beneath

him. Without pausing to think, he aimed high at the

 

spider’s underbelly, as he had done with the skrewt,

and shouted “Stupefyl” just as Cedric yelled the same

thing.

The two spells combined did what one alone had not:

The spider keeled over sideways, flattening a nearby

hedge, and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy

legs.

“Harry!” he heard Cedric shouting. “You all right? Did

it fall on you?”

“No,” Harry called back, panting. He looked down at

his leg. It was bleeding freely. He could see some sort

of thick, gluey secretion from the spider’s pincers on

his torn robes. He tried to get up, but his leg was

shaking badly and did not want to support his weight.

He leaned against the hedge, gasping for breath, and

looked around.

Cedric was standing feet from the Triwizard Cup,

which was gleaming behind him.

“Take it, then,” Harry panted to Cedric. “Go on, take

it. You’re there.”

But Cedric didn’t move. He merely stood there,

looking at Harry. Then he turned to stare at the cup.

Harry saw the longing expression on his face in its

golden light. Cedric looked around at Harry again,

who was now holding onto the hedge to support

himself. Cedric took a deep breath.

“You take it. You should win. That’s twice you’ve

saved my neck in here.”

“That’s not how it’s supposed to work,” Harry said. He

felt angry; his leg was very painful, he was aching all

over from trying to throw off the spider, and after all

 

his efforts, Cedric had beaten him to it, just as he’d

beaten Harry to ask Cho to the ball. “The one who

reaches the cup first gets the points. That’s you. I’m

telling you, I’m not going to win any races on this leg.”

Cedric took a few paces nearer to the Stunned spider,

away from the cup, shaking his head.

“No,” he said.

“Stop being noble,” said Harry irritably. “Just take it,

then we can get out of here.”

Cedric watched Harry steadying himself, holding tight

to the hedge.

“You told me about the dragons,” Cedric said. “I

would’ve gone down in the first task if you hadn’t told

me what was coming.”

“I had help on that too,” Harry snapped, trying to mop

up his bloody leg with his robes. “You helped me with

the egg — we’re square.”

“I had help on the egg in the first place,” said Cedric.

“We’re still square,” said Harry, testing his leg

gingerly; it shook violently as he put weight on it; he

had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped

him.

“You should’ve got more points on the second task,”

said Cedric mulishly. “You stayed behind to get all the

hostages. I should’ve done that.”

“I was the only one who was thick enough to take that

song seriously!” said Harry bitterly. “Just take the

cup!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“No,” said Cedric.

He stepped over the spider’s tangled legs to join

Harry, who stared at him. Cedric was serious. He was

walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff House

hadn’t had in centuries.

“Go on,” Cedric said. He looked as though this was

costing him every ounce of resolution he had, but his

face was set, his arms were folded, he seemed

decided.

Harry looked from Cedric to the cup. For one shining

moment, he saw himself emerging from the maze,

holding it. He saw himself holding the Triwizard Cup

aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw Cho’s face

shining with admiration, more clearly than he had

ever seen it before ... and then the picture faded, and

he found himself staring at Cedric’s shadowy,

stubborn face.

“Both of us,” Harry said.

“What?”

“Well take it at the same time. It’s still a Hogwarts

victory. We’ll tie for it.”

Cedric stared at Harry. He unfolded his arms.

“You — you sure?”

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah ... we’ve helped each other

out, haven’t we? We both got here. Let’s just take it

together.”

For a moment, Cedric looked as though he couldn’t

believe his ears; then his face split in a grin.

 

“You’re on,” he said. “Come here.”

He grabbed Harry’s arm below the shoulder and

helped Harry limp toward the plinth where the cup

stood. When they had reached it, they both held a

hand out over one of the cup’s gleaming handles.

“On three, right?” said Harry. “One — two — three — ”

He and Cedric both grasped a handle.

Instantly, Harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his

navel. His feet had left the ground. He could not

unclench the hand holding the Triwizard Cup; it was

pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling

color, Cedric at his side.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

FLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE

Harry felt his feet slam into the ground; his injured

leg gave way, and he fell forward; his hand let go of

the Triwizard Cup at last. He raised his head.

“Where are we?” he said.

Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his

feet, and they looked around.

They had left the Hogwarts grounds completely; they

had obviously traveled miles — perhaps hundreds of

miles — for even the mountains surrounding the

castle were gone. They were standing instead in a

dark and overgrown graveyard; the black outline of a

small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to

their right. A hill rose above them to their left. Harry

could just make out the outline of a fine old house on

the hillside.

Cedric looked down at the Triwizard Cup and then up

at Harry.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Did anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?” he

asked.

“Nope,” said Harry. He was looking around the

graveyard. It was completely silent and slightly eerie.

“Is this supposed to be part of the task?”

“I dunno,” said Cedric. He sounded slightly nervous.

“Wands out, d’you reckon?”

“Yeah,” said Harry, glad that Cedric had made the

suggestion rather than him.

They pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking

around him. He had, yet again, the strange feeling

that they were being watched.

“Someone’s coming,” he said suddenly.

Squinting tensely through the darkness, they watched

the figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward

them between the graves. Harry couldn’t make out a

face, but from the way it was walking and holding its

arms, he could tell that it was carrying something.

Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded

cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face. And

— several paces nearer, the gap between them closing

all the time — Harry saw that the thing in the

person’s arms looked like a baby ... or was it merely a

bundle of robes?

Harry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways

at Cedric. Cedric shot him a quizzical look. They both

turned back to watch the approaching figure.

It stopped beside a towering marble headstone, only

six feet from them. For a second, Harry and Cedric

and the short figure simply looked at one another.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

And then, without warning, Harry’s scar exploded

with pain. It was agony such as he had never felt in

all his life; his wand slipped from his fingers as he put

his hands over his face; his knees buckled; he was on

the ground and he could see nothing at all; his head

was about to split open.

From far away, above his head, he heard a high, cold

voice say, “Kill the spare.”

A swishing noise and a second voice, which screeched

the words to the night: “Avada KedavraV’

A blast of green light blazed through Harry’s eyelids,

and he heard something heavy fall to the ground

beside him; the pain in his scar reached such a pitch

that he retched, and then it diminished; terrified of

what he was about to see, he opened his stinging

eyes.

Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside

him. He was dead.

For a second that contained an eternity, Harry stared

into Cedric’s face, at his open gray eyes, blank and

expressionless as the windows of a deserted house, at

his half-open mouth, which looked slightly surprised.

And then, before Harry’s mind had accepted what he

was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb

disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet.

The short man in the cloak had put down his bundle,

lit his wand, and was dragging Harry toward the

marble headstone. Harry saw the name upon it

flickering in the wandlight before he was forced

around and slammed against it.

TOM RIDDLE

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

The cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords

around Harry, tying him from neck to ankles to the

headstone. Harry could hear shallow, fast breathing

from the depths of the hood; he struggled, and the

man hit him — hit him with a hand that had a finger

missing. And Harry realized who was under the hood.

It was Wormtail.

“You!” he gasped.

But Wormtail, who had finished conjuring the ropes,

did not reply; he was busy checking the tightness of

the cords, his fingers trembling uncontrollably,

fumbling over the knots. Once sure that Harry was

bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldn’t

move an inch, Wormtail drew a length of some black

material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it

roughly into Harry’s mouth; then, without a word, he

turned from Harry and hurried away. Harry couldn’t

make a sound, nor could he see where Wormtail had

gone; he couldn’t turn his head to see beyond the

headstone; he could see only what was right in front

of him.

Cedric’s body was lying some twenty feet away. Some

way beyond him, glinting in the starlight, lay the

Triwizard Cup. Harry’s wand was on the ground at

Cedric’s feet. The bundle of robes that Harry had

thought was a baby was close by, at the foot of the

grave. It seemed to be stirring fretfully. Harry watched

it, and his scar seared with pain again . . . and he

suddenly knew that he didn’t want to see what was in

those robes ... he didn’t want that bundle opened. ...

He could hear noises at his feet. He looked down and

saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass,

circling the headstone where he was tied. Wormtail’s

fast, wheezy breathing was growing louder again. It

sounded as though he was forcing something heavy

 

across the ground. Then he came back within Harry’s

range of vision, and Harry saw him pushing a stone

cauldron to the foot of the grave. It was full of what

seemed to be water — Harry could hear it slopping

around — and it was larger than any cauldron Harry

had ever used; a great stone belly large enough for a

full-grown man to sit in.

The thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground

was stirring more persistently, as though it was trying

to free itself. Now Wormtail was busying himself at

the bottom of the cauldron with a wand. Suddenly

there were crackling flames beneath it. The large

snake slithered away into the darkness.

The liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast.

The surface began not only to bubble, but to send out

fiery sparks, as though it were on fire. Steam was

thickening, blurring the outline of Wormtail tending

the fire. The movements beneath the robes became

more agitated. And Harry heard the high, cold voice

again.

“Hurry\”

The whole surface of the water was alight with sparks

now. It might have been encrusted with diamonds.

“It is ready, Master.”

“Now ...” said the cold voice.

Wormtail pulled open the robes on the ground,

revealing what was inside them, and Harry let out a

yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking

his mouth.

It was as though Wormtail had flipped over a stone

and revealed something ugly, slimy, and blind — but

 

worse, a hundred times worse. The thing Wormtail

had been carrying had the shape of a crouched

human child, except that Harry had never seen

anything less like a child. It was hairless and scaly -

looking, a dark, raw, reddish black. Its arms and legs

were thin and feeble, and its face — no child alive

ever had a face like that — flat and snakelike, with

gleaming red eyes.

The thing seemed almost helpless; it raised its thin

arms, put them around Wormtail’s neck, and

Wormtail lifted it. As he did so, his hood fell back,

and Harry saw the look of revulsion on Wormtail’s

weak, pale face in the firelight as he carried the

creature to the rim of the cauldron. For one moment,

Harry saw the evil, flat face illuminated in the sparks

dancing on the surface of the potion. And then

Wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron;

there was a hiss, and it vanished below the surface;

Harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft

thud.

Let it drown, Harry thought, his scar burning almost

past endurance, please ... let it drown. ...

Wormtail was speaking. His voice shook; he seemed

frightened beyond his wits. He raised his wand,

closed his eyes, and spoke to the night.

“Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew

your son!”

The surface of the grave at Harry’s feet cracked.

Horrified, Harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose

into the air at Wormtail’s command and fell softly into

the cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke

and hissed; it sent sparks in all directions and turned

a vivid, poisonous-looking blue.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

And now Wormtail was whimpering. He pulled a long,

thin, shining silver dagger from inside his cloak. His

voice broke into petrified sobs.

“ Flesh — of the servant — w-willingly given — you will

— revive — your master.”

He stretched his right hand out in front of him — the

hand with the missing finger. He gripped the dagger

very tightly in his left hand and swung it upward.

Harry realized what Wormtail was about to do a

second before it happened — he closed his eyes as

tightly as he could, but he could not block the scream

that pierced the night, that went through Harry as

though he had been stabbed with the dagger too. He

heard something fall to the ground, heard Wormtail’s

anguished panting, then a sickening splash, as

something was dropped into the cauldron. Harry

couldn’t stand to look ... but the potion had turned a

burning red; the light of it shone through Harry’s

closed eyelids...

Wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony. Not

until Harry felt Wormtail’s anguished breath on his

face did he realize that Wormtail was right in front of

him.

“B-blood of the enemy ... forcibly taken ... you will ...

resurrect your foe.”

Harry could do nothing to prevent it, he was tied too

tightly. ... Squinting down, struggling hopelessly at

the ropes binding him, he saw the shining silver

dagger shaking in Wormtail’s remaining hand. He felt

its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and

blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes.

Wormtail, still panting with pain, fumbled in his

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

pocket for a glass vial and held it to Harry’s cut, so

that a dribble of blood fell into it.

He staggered back to the cauldron with Harry’s blood.

He poured it inside. The liquid within turned,

instantly, a blinding white. Wormtail, his job done,

dropped to his knees beside the cauldron, then

slumped sideways and lay on the ground, cradling the

bleeding stump of his arm, gasping and sobbing.

The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond

sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it

turned all else to velvety blackness. Nothing

happened. ...

Let it have drowned, Harry thought, let it have gone

wrong. ...

And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the

cauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam

billowed thickly from the cauldron instead,

obliterating everything in front of Harry, so that he

couldn’t see Wormtail or Cedric or anything but vapor

hanging in the air. . . It’s gone wrong, he thought . . . it’s

drowned . . . please . . . please let it be dead. . .

But then, through the mist in front of him, he saw,

with an icy surge of terror, the dark outline of a man,

tall and skeletally thin, rising slowly from inside the

cauldron.

“Robe me,” said the high, cold voice from behind the

steam, and Wormtail, sobbing and moaning, still

cradling his mutilated arm, scrambled to pick up the

black robes from the ground, got to his feet, reached

up, and pulled them one-handed over his master’s

head.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at

Harry . . . and Harry stared back into the face that had

haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a

skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that

was flat as a snake’s with slits for nostrils ...

Lord Voldemort had risen again.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE DEATH EATERS

Voldemort looked away from Harry and began

examining his own body. His hands were like large,

pale spiders; his long white fingers caressed his own

chest, his arms, his face; the red eyes, whose pupils

were slits, like a cat’s, gleamed still more brightly

through the darkness. He held up his hands and

flexed the fingers, his expression rapt and exultant.

He took not the slightest notice of Wormtail, who lay

twitching and bleeding on the ground, nor of the great

snake, which had slithered back into sight and was

circling Harry again, hissing. Voldemort slipped one of

those unnaturally long-fingered hands into a deep

pocket and drew out a wand. He caressed it gently

too; and then he raised it, and pointed it at Wormtail,

who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the

headstone where Harry was tied; he fell to the foot of

it and lay there, crumpled up and crying. Voldemort

turned his scarlet eyes upon Harry, laughing a high,

cold, mirthless laugh.

Wormtail’s robes were shining with blood now; he had

wrapped the stump of his arm in them.

 

“My Lord ...” he choked, “my Lord ... you promised ...

you did promise ...”

“Hold out your arm,” said Voldemort lazily.

“Oh Master ... thank you, Master ...”

He extended the bleeding stump, but Voldemort

laughed again.

“The other arm, Wormtail.”

“Master, please ... please ...”

Voldemort bent down and pulled out Wormtail’s left

arm; he forced the sleeve of Wormtail’s robes up past

his elbow, and Harry saw something upon the skin

there, something like a vivid red tattoo — a skull with

a snake protruding from its mouth — the image that

had appeared in the sky at the Quidditch World Cup:

the Dark Mark. Voldemort examined it carefully,

ignoring Wormtail’s uncontrollable weeping.

“It is back,” he said softly, “they will all have noticed it

... and now, we shall see ... now we shall know ...”

He pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on

Wormtail’s arm.

The scar on Harry’s forehead seared with a sharp

pain again, and Wormtail let out a fresh howl;

Voldemort removed his fingers from Wormtail’s mark,

and Harry saw that it had turned jet black.

A look of cruel satisfaction on his face, Voldemort

straightened up, threw back his head, and stared

around at the dark graveyard.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“How many will be brave enough to return when they

feel it?” he whispered, his gleaming red eyes fixed

upon the stars. “And how many will be foolish enough

to stay away?”

He began to pace up and down before Harry and

Wormtail, eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while.

After a minute or so, he looked down at Harry again,

a cruel smile twisting his snakelike face.

“You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late

father,” he hissed softly. “A Muggle and a fool ... very

like your dear mother. But they both had their uses,

did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a

child . . . and I killed my father, and see how useful he

has proved himself, in death. ...”

Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced,

looking all around him as he walked, and the snake

continued to circle in the grass.

“You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My

father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here

in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned

her when she told him what she was. ... He didn’t like

magic, my father . . .

“He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before

I was even born, Potter, and she died giving birth to

me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage ...

but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon

him, that fool who gave me his name . . . Tom Riddle.

Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to

grave.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Listen to me, reliving family history ...” he said

quietly, “why, I am growing quite sentimental. ... But

look, Harry! My true family returns. ...”

The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks.

Between graves, behind the yew tree, in every

shadowy space, wizards were Apparating. All of them

were hooded and masked. And one by one they moved

forward . . . slowly, cautiously, as though they could

hardly believe their eyes. Voldemort stood in silence,

waiting for them. Then one of the Death Eaters fell to

his knees, crawled toward Voldemort, and kissed the

hem of his black robes.

“Master ... Master ...” he murmured.

The Death Eaters behind him did the same; each of

them approaching Voldemort on his knees and

kissing his robes, before backing away and standing

up, forming a silent circle, which enclosed Tom

Riddle’s grave, Harry, Voldemort, and the sobbing and

twitching heap that was Wormtail. Yet they left gaps

in the circle, as though waiting for more people.

Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. He

looked around at the hooded faces, and though there

was no wind, a rustling seemed to run around the

circle, as though it had shivered.

“Welcome, Death Eaters,” said Voldemort quietly.

“Thirteen years ... thirteen years since last we met.

Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday.

... We are still united under the Dark Mark, then! Or

are we?”

He put back his terrible face and sniffed, his slit-like

nostrils widening.

“I smell guilt,” he said. “There is a stench of guilt

upon the air.”

 

A second shiver ran around the circle, as though each

member of it longed, but did not dare, to step back

from him.

“I see you all, whole and healthy, with your powers

intact — such prompt appearances! — and I ask

myself . . . why did this band of wizards never come to

the aid of their master, to whom they swore eternal

loyalty?”

No one spoke. No one moved except Wormtail, who

was upon the ground, still sobbing over his bleeding

arm.

“And I answer myself,” whispered Voldemort, “they

must have believed me broken, they thought I was

gone. They slipped back among my enemies, and they

pleaded innocence, and ignorance, and bewitchment.

“And then I ask myself, but how could they have

believed I would not rise again? They, who knew the

steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal

death? They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of

my power in the times when I was mightier than any

wizard living?

“And I answer myself, perhaps they believed a still

greater power could exist, one that could vanquish

even Lord Voldemort ... perhaps they now pay

allegiance to another . . . perhaps that champion of

commoners, of Mudbloods and Muggles, Albus

Dumbledore?”

At the mention of Dumbledore’s name, the members

of the circle stirred, and some muttered and shook

their heads. Voldemort ignored them.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“It is a disappointment to me ... I confess myself

disappointed. ...”

One of the men suddenly flung himself forward,

breaking the circle. Trembling from head to foot, he

collapsed at Voldemort’s feet.

“Master!” he shrieked, “Master, forgive me! Forgive us

all!”

Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.

“ Cruciol ”

The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked;

Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses

around. ... Let the police come, he thought desperately

... anyone ... anything ...

Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater

lay flat upon the ground, gasping.

“Get up, Avery,” said Voldemort softly. “Stand up. You

ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget.

Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years’

repayment before I forgive you. Wormtail here has

paid some of his debt already, have you not,

Wormtail?”

He looked down at Wormtail, who continued to sob.

“You returned to me, not out of loyalty, but out of fear

of your old friends. You deserve this pain, Wormtail.

You know that, don’t you?”

“Yes, Master,” moaned Wormtail, “please, Master ...

please ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Yet you helped return me to my body,” said

Voldemort coolly, watching Wormtail sob on the

ground. “Worthless and traitorous as you are, you

helped me . . . and Lord Voldemort rewards his

helpers. ...”

Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it

through the air. A streak of what looked like molten

silver hung shining in the wand’s wake. Momentarily

shapeless, it writhed and then formed itself into a

gleaming replica of a human hand, bright as

moonlight, which soared downward and fixed itself

upon Wormtail’s bleeding wrist.

Wormtail’s sobbing stopped abruptly. His breathing

harsh and ragged, he raised his head and stared in

disbelief at the silver hand, now attached seamlessly

to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling

glove. He flexed the shining fingers, then, trembling,

picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it

into powder.

“My Lord,” he whispered. “Master ... it is beautiful ...

thank you ... thank you. ...”

He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the

hem of Voldemort’s robes.

“May your loyalty never waver again, Wormtail,” said

Voldemort.

“No, my Lord ... never, my Lord ...”

Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle,

staring at his powerful new hand, his face still

shining with tears. Voldemort now approached the

man on Wormtail’s right.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Lucius, my slippery friend,” he whispered, halting

before him. “I am told that you have not renounced

the old ways, though to the world you present a

respectable face. You are still ready to take the lead in

a spot of Muggle-torture, I believe? Yet you never tried

to find me, Lucius. ... Your exploits at the Quidditch

World Cup were fun, I daresay ... but might not your

energies have been better directed toward finding and

aiding your master?”

“My Lord, I was constantly on the alert,” came Lucius

Malfoy’s voice swiftly from beneath the hood. “Had

there been any sign from you, any whisper of your

whereabouts, I would have been at your side

immediately, nothing could have prevented me — ”

“And yet you ran from my Mark, when a faithful

Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer?” said

Voldemort lazily, and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking

abruptly. “Yes, I know all about that, Lucius. ... You

have disappointed me. ... I expect more faithful

service in the future.”

“Of course, my Lord, of course. ... You are merciful,

thank you. ...”

Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the

space — large enough for two people — that

separated Malfoy and the next man.

“The Lestranges should stand here,” said Voldemort

quietly. “But they are entombed in Azkaban. They

were faithful. They went to Azkaban rather than

renounce me. ... When Azkaban is broken open, the

Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams. The

dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ...

we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all

my devoted servants returned to me, and an army of

creatures whom all fear. ...”

 

He walked on. Some of the Death Eaters he passed in

silence, but he paused before others and spoke to

them.

“Macnair . . . destroying dangerous beasts for the

Ministry of Magic now, Wormtail tells me? You shall

have better victims than that soon, Macnair. Lord

Voldemort will provide. ...”

“Thank you, Master ... thank you,” murmured

Macnair.

“And here” — Voldemort moved on to the two largest

hooded figures — “we have Crabbe . . . you will do

better this time, will you not, Crabbe? And you,

Goyle?”

They bowed clumsily, muttering dully.

“Yes, Master ...”

“We will, Master. ...”

“The same goes for you, Nott,” said Voldemort quietly

as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyle ’s

shadow.

“My Lord, I prostrate myself before you, I am your

most faithful — ”

“That will do,” said Voldemort.

He had reached the largest gap of all, and he stood

surveying it with his blank, red eyes, as though he

could see people standing there.

“And here we have six missing Death Eaters . . . three

dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... he

will pay. One, who I believe has left me forever ... he

 

will be killed, of course ... and one, who remains my

most faithful servant, and who has already reentered

my service.”

The Death Eaters stirred, and Harry saw their eyes

dart sideways at one another through their masks.

“He is at Hogwarts, that faithful servant, and it was

through his efforts that our young friend arrived here

tonight. ...

“Yes,” said Voldemort, a grin curling his lipless mouth

as the eyes of the circle flashed in Harry’s direction.

“Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing

party. One might go so far as to call him my guest of

honor.”

There was a silence. Then the Death Eater to the right

of Wormtail stepped forward, and Lucius Malfoy’s

voice spoke from under the mask.

“Master, we crave to know . . . we beg you to tell us . . .

how you have achieved this . . . this miracle . . . how

you managed to return to us. ...”

“Ah, what a story it is, Lucius,” said Voldemort. “And

it begins — and ends — with my young friend here.”

He walked lazily over to stand next to Harry, so that

the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of

them. The snake continued to circle.

“You know, of course, that they have called this boy

my downfall?” Voldemort said softly, his red eyes

upon Harry, whose scar began to burn so fiercely that

he almost screamed in agony. “You all know that on

the night I lost my powers and my body, I tried to kill

him. His mother died in the attempt to save him —

and unwittingly provided him with a protection I

 

admit I had not foreseen. ... I could not touch the

boy.”

Voldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put

it very close to Harry’s cheek.

“His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice.

. . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I

was foolish to overlook it . . . but no matter. I can

touch him now.”

Harry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch

him, and thought his head would burst with the pain.

Voldemort laughed softly in his ear, then took the

finger away and continued addressing the Death

Eaters.

“I miscalculated, my friends, I admit it. My curse was

deflected by the woman’s foolish sacrifice, and it

rebounded upon myself. Aaah . . . pain beyond pain,

my friends; nothing could have prepared me for it. I

was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less

than the meanest ghost ... but still, I was alive. What

I was, even I do not know ... I, who have gone further

than anybody along the path that leads to

immortality. You know my goal — to conquer death.

And now, I was tested, and it appeared that one or

more of my experiments had worked . . . for I had not

been killed, though the curse should have done it.

Nevertheless, I was as powerless as the weakest

creature alive, and without the means to help myself

. . . for I had no body, and every spell that might have

helped me required the use of a wand. ...

“I remember only forcing myself, sleeplessly,

endlessly, second by second, to exist. ... I settled in a

faraway place, in a forest, and I waited. ... Surely, one

of my faithful Death Eaters would try and find me . . .

one of them would come and perform the magic I

 

could not, to restore me to a body . . . but I waited in

vain. ...”

The shiver ran once more around the circle of

listening Death Eaters. Voldemort let the silence

spiral horribly before continuing.

“Only one power remained to me. I could possess the

bodies of others. But I dared not go where other

humans were plentiful, for I knew that the Aurors

were still abroad and searching for me. I sometimes

inhabited animals — snakes, of course, being my

preference — but I was little better off inside them

than as pure spirit, for their bodies were ill adapted to

perform magic ... and my possession of them

shortened their lives; none of them lasted long. ...

“Then . . . four years ago . . . the means for my return

seemed assured. A wizard — young, foolish, and

gullible — wandered across my path in the forest I

had made my home. Oh, he seemed the very chance I

had been dreaming of . . . for he was a teacher at

Dumbledore’s school ... he was easy to bend to my

will ... he brought me back to this country, and after

a while, I took possession of his body, to supervise

him closely as he carried out my orders. But my plan

failed. I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer’s Stone. I

was not to be assured immortal life. I was thwarted ...

thwarted, once again, by Harry Potter. ...”

Silence once more; nothing was stirring, not even the

leaves on the yew tree. The Death Eaters were quite

motionless, the glittering eyes in their masks fixed

upon Voldemort, and upon Harry.

“The servant died when I left his body, and I was left

as weak as ever I had been,” Voldemort continued. “I

returned to my hiding place far away, and I will not

pretend to you that I didn’t then fear that I might

 

never regain my powers. ... Yes, that was perhaps my

darkest hour ... I could not hope that I would be sent

another wizard to possess ... and I had given up hope,

now, that any of my Death Eaters cared what had

become of me. ...”

One or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved

uncomfortably, but Voldemort took no notice.

“And then, not even a year ago, when I had almost

abandoned hope, it happened at last ... a servant

returned to me. Wormtail here, who had faked his

own death to escape justice, was driven out of hiding

by those he had once counted friends, and decided to

return to his master. He sought me in the country

where it had long been rumored I was hiding . . .

helped, of course, by the rats he met along the way.

Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats, do you not,

Wormtail? His filthy little friends told him there was a

place, deep in an Albanian forest, that they avoided,

where small animals like themselves had met their

deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them. ...

“But his journey back to me was not smooth, was it,

Wormtail? For, hungry one night, on the edge of the

very forest where he had hoped to find me, he

foolishly stopped at an inn for some food . . . and who

should he meet there, but one Bertha Jorkins, a

witch from the Ministry of Magic.

“Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort.

This might have been the end of Wormtail, and of my

last hope for regeneration. But Wormtail — displaying

a presence of mind I would never have expected from

him — convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him

on a nighttime stroll. He overpowered her ... he

brought her to me. And Bertha Jorkins, who might

have ruined all, proved instead to be a gift beyond my

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

wildest dreams . . . for — with a little persuasion — she

became a veritable mine of information.

“She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be

played at Hogwarts this year. She told me that she

knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too

willing to help me, if I could only contact him. She

told me many things . . . but the means I used to break

the Memory Charm upon her were powerful, and

when I had extracted all useful information from her,

her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair.

She had now served her purpose. I could not possess

her. I disposed of her.”

Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes

blank and pitiless.

“Wormtail’s body, of course, was ill adapted for

possession, as all assumed him dead, and would

attract far too much attention if noticed. However, he

was the able-bodied servant I needed, and, poor

wizard though he is, Wormtail was able to follow the

instructions I gave him, which would return me to a

rudimentary, weak body of my own, a body I would be

able to inhabit while awaiting the essential

ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my

own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini,”

Voldemort’s red eyes fell upon the continually circling

snake, “a potion concocted from unicorn blood, and

the snake venom Nagini provided ... I was soon

returned to an almost human form, and strong

enough to travel.

“There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer’s Stone

anymore, for I knew that Dumbledore would have

seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to

embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortality.

I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body

back again, and my old strength.

 

“I knew that to achieve this — it is an old piece of

Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight — I

would need three powerful ingredients. Well, one of

them was already at hand, was it not, Wormtail?

Flesh given by a servant. ...

“My father’s bone, naturally, meant that we would

have to come here, where he was buried. But the

blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any

wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who

had hated me ... as so many of them still do. But I

knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more

powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted

Harry Potter’s blood. I wanted the blood of the one

who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . .

for the lingering protection his mother once gave him

would then reside in my veins too. ...

“But how to get at Harry Potter? For he has been

better protected than I think even he knows,

protected in ways devised by Dumbledore long ago,

when it fell to him to arrange the boy’s future.

Dumbledore invoked an ancient magic, to ensure the

boy’s protection as long as he is in his relations’ care.

Not even I can touch him there. ... Then, of course,

there was the Quidditch World Cup. ... I thought his

protection might be weaker there, away from his

relations and Dumbledore, but I was not yet strong

enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of

Ministry wizards. And then, the boy would return to

Hogwarts, where he is under the crooked nose of that

Muggle-loving fool from morning until night. So how

could I take him?

“Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins’s information, of

course. Use my one faithful Death Eater, stationed at

Hogwarts, to ensure that the boy’s name was entered

into the Goblet of Fire. Use my Death Eater to ensure

that the boy won the tournament — that he touched

 

the Triwizard Cup first — the cup which my Death

Eater had turned into a Portkey, which would bring

him here, beyond the reach of Dumbledore’s help and

protection, and into my waiting arms. And here he is

... the boy you all believed had been my downfall...”

Voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face

Harry. He raised his wand.

“Crucio\”

It was pain beyond anything Harry had ever

experienced; his very bones were on fire; his head was

surely splitting along his scar; his eyes were rolling

madly in his head; he wanted it to end ... to black out

...to die ...

And then it was gone. He was hanging limply in the

ropes binding him to the headstone of Voldemort’s

father, looking up into those bright red eyes through

a kind of mist. The night was ringing with the sound

of the Death Eaters’ laughter.

“You see, I think, how foolish it was to suppose that

this boy could ever have been stronger than me,” said

Voldemort. “But I want there to be no mistake in

anybody’s mind. Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky

chance. And I am now going to prove my power by

killing him, here and now, in front of you all, when

there is no Dumbledore to help him, and no mother to

die for him. I will give him his chance. He will be

allowed to fight, and you will be left in no doubt

which of us is the stronger. Just a little longer,

Nagini,” he whispered, and the snake glided away

through the grass to where the Death Eaters stood

watching.

“Now untie him, Wormtail, and give him back his

wand.”

 

PRIORI INCANTATEM

Wormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find

his feet, to support his own weight before the ropes

were untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand,

pulled out the wad of material gagging Harry, and

then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying

Harry to the gravestone.

There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might

have considered running for it, but his injured leg

shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave,

as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter

circle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps

where the missing Death Eaters should have stood

were filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the

place where Cedric’s body lay and returned with

Harry’s wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry’s

hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed

his place in the circle of watching Death Eaters.

“You have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?”

said Voldemort softly, his red eyes glinting through

the darkness.

 

At these words Harry remembered, as though from a

former life, the dueling club at Hogwarts he had

attended briefly two years ago. ... All he had learned

there was the Disarming Spell, “ Expelliarmus” ... and

what use would it be to deprive Voldemort of his

wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by

Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one?

He had never learned anything that could possibly fit

him for this. He knew he was facing the thing against

which Moody had always warned . . . the un-blockable

Avada Kedavra curse — and Voldemort was right —

his mother was not here to die for him this time. ...

He was quite unprotected. ...

“We bow to each other, Harry,” said Voldemort,

bending a little, but keeping his snakelike face

upturned to Harry. “Come, the niceties must be

observed. ... Dumbledore would like you to show

manners. ... Bow to death, Harry. ...”

The Death Eaters were laughing again. Voldemort’s

lipless mouth was smiling. Harry did not bow. He was

not going to let Voldemort play with him before killing

him ... he was not going to give him that satisfaction.

“I said, bow,” Voldemort said, raising his wand — and

Harry felt his spine curve as though a huge, invisible

hand were bending him ruthlessly forward, and the

Death Eaters laughed harder than ever.

“Very good,” said Voldemort softly, and as he raised

his wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted

too. “And now you face me, like a man ... straight-

backed and proud, the way your father died. ...

“And now — we duel.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Voldemort raised his wand, and before Harry could do

anything to defend himself, before he could even

move, he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse.

The pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no

longer knew where he was. ... White-hot knives were

piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely

going to burst with pain, he was screaming more

loudly than he’d ever screamed in his life —

And then it stopped. Harry rolled over and scrambled

to his feet; he was shaking as uncontrollably as

Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off;

he staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death

Eaters, and they pushed him away, back toward

Voldemort.

“A little break,” said Voldemort, the slit-like nostrils

dilating with excitement, “a little pause . . . That hurt,

didn’t it, Harry? You don’t want me to do that again,

do you?”

Harry didn’t answer. He was going to die like Cedric,

those pitiless red eyes were telling him so ... he was

going to die, and there was nothing he could do about

it... but he wasn’t going to play along. He wasn’t going

to obey Voldemort ... he wasn’t going to beg. ...

“I asked you whether you want me to do that again,”

said Voldemort softly. “Answer me! ImperioV’

And Harry felt, for the third time in his life, the

sensation that his mind had been wiped of all

thought. ... Ah, it was bliss, not to think, it was as

though he were floating, dreaming ... just answer no

. . . say no ... just answer no. . . .

I will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his

head, I won’t answer. ...

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Just answer no. ...

I won’t do it, I won’t say it. ...

Just answer no. ...

“I WONT!”

And these words burst from Harry’s mouth; they

echoed through the graveyard, and the dream state

was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been

thrown over him — back rushed the aches that the

Cruciatus Curse had left all over his body — back

rushed the realization of where he was, and what he

was facing. ...

“You won’t?” said Voldemort quietly, and the Death

Eaters were not laughing now. “You won’t say no?

Harry, obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before

you die. ... Perhaps another little dose of pain?”

Voldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was

ready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch

training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground;

he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort’s

father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed

him.

“We are not playing hide-and-seek, Harry,” said

Voldemort’s soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, as the

Death Eaters laughed. “You cannot hide from me.

Does this mean you are tired of our duel? Does this

mean that you would prefer me to finish it now,

Harry? Come out, Harry . . . come out and play, then

...it will be quick ... it might even be painless ... I

would not know ... I have never died. ...”

Harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the

end had come. There was no hope ... no help to be

 

had. And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he

knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or

reason: He was not going to die crouching here like a

child playing hide-and-seek; he was not going to die

kneeling at Voldemort’s feet ... he was going to die

upright like his father, and he was going to die trying

to defend himself, even if no defense was possible. ...

Before Voldemort could stick his snakelike face

around the headstone, Harry stood up ... he gripped

his wand tightly in his hand, thrust it out in front of

him, and threw himself around the headstone, facing

Voldemort.

Voldemort was ready. As Harry shouted,

“ ExpelliarmusV’ Voldemort cried, “Avada KedavraV’

A jet of green light issued from Voldemort’s wand just

as a jet of red light blasted from Harry’s — they met

in midair — and suddenly Harry’s wand was vibrating

as though an electric charge were surging through it;

his hand seized up around it; he couldn’t have

released it if he’d wanted to — and a narrow beam of

light connected the two wands, neither red nor green,

but bright, deep gold. Harry, following the beam with

his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort’s long white

fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking

and vibrating.

And then — nothing could have prepared Harry for

this — he felt his feet lift from the ground. He and

Voldemort were both being raised into the air, their

wands still connected by that thread of shimmering

golden light. They glided away from the tombstone of

Voldemort’s father and then came to rest on a patch

of ground that was clear and free of graves. ... The

Death Eaters were shouting; they were asking

Voldemort for instructions; they were closing in,

reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort, the

 

snake slithering at their heels, some of them drawing

their wands —

The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort

splintered; though the wands remained connected, a

thousand more beams arced high over Harry and

Voldemort, crisscrossing all around them, until they

were enclosed in a golden, dome-shaped web, a cage

of light, beyond which the Death Eaters circled like

jackals, their cries strangely muffled now. ...

“Do nothing!” Voldemort shrieked to the Death

Eaters, and Harry saw his red eyes wide with

astonishment at what was happening, saw him

fighting to break the thread of light still connecting

his wand with Harry’s; Harry held onto his wand

more tightly, with both hands, and the golden thread

remained unbroken. “Do nothing unless I command

you!” Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters.

And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the

air. ... It was coming from every thread of the light-

spun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort. It

was a sound Harry recognized, though he had heard

it only once before in his life: phoenix song.

It was the sound of hope to Harry . . . the most

beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his

life. ... He felt as though the song were inside him

instead of just around him. ... It was the sound he

connected with Dumbledore, and it was almost as

though a friend were speaking in his ear. . . .

Don’t break the connection.

I know, Harry told the music, I know I mustn’t ... but

no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became

much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more

powerfully than ever . . . and now the beam between

 

him and Voldemort changed too ... it was as though

large beads of light were sliding up and down the

thread connecting the wands — Harry felt his wand

give a shudder under his hand as the light beads

began to slide slowly and steadily his way. . . . The

direction of the beam’s movement was now toward

him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder

angrily. ...

As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harry’s

wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he

feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead

moved, the harder Harry’s wand vibrated; he was sure

his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as

though it was about to shatter under his fingers —

He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon

forcing the bead back toward Voldemort, his ears full

of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixed ... and slowly,

very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then,

just as slowly, they began to move the other way ...

and it was Voldemort ’s wand that was vibrating extra-

hard now ... Voldemort who looked astonished, and

almost fearful. ...

One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from

the tip of Voldemort’s wand. Harry didn’t understand

why he was doing it, didn’t know what it might

achieve . . . but he now concentrated as he had never

done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back

into Voldemort’s wand ... and slowly ... very slowly ...

it moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a

moment... and then it connected. ...

At once, Voldemort’s wand began to emit echoing

screams of pain ... then — Voldemort’s red eyes

widened with shock — a dense, smoky hand flew out

of the tip of it and vanished . . . the ghost of the hand

he had made Wormtail ... more shouts of pain ... and

 

then something much larger began to blossom from

Voldemort’s wand tip, a great, grayish something,

that looked as though it were made of the solidest,

densest smoke. ... It was a head ... now a chest and

arms . . . the torso of Cedric Diggory.

If ever Harry might have released his wand from

shock, it would have been then, but instinct kept him

clutching his wand tightly, so that the thread of

golden light remained unbroken, even though the

thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory (was it a ghost? it

looked so solid) emerged in its entirety from the end of

Voldemort’s wand, as though it were squeezing itself

out of a very narrow tunnel . . . and this shade of

Cedric stood up, and looked up and down the golden

thread of light, and spoke.

“Hold on, Harry,” it said.

Its voice was distant and echoing. Harry looked at

Voldemort . . . his wide red eyes were still shocked . . .

he had no more expected this than Harry had . . . and,

very dimly, Harry heard the frightened yells of the

Death Eaters, prowling around the edges of the

golden dome. ...

More screams of pain from the wand . . . and then

something else emerged from its tip . . . the dense

shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms

and torso ... an old man Harry had seen only in a

dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the

wand just as Cedric had done ... and his ghost, or his

shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric’s, and

surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web,

and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning

on his walking stick. . . .

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“He was a real wizard, then?” the old man said, his

eyes on Voldemort. “Killed me, that one did. ... You

fight him, boy. ...”

But already, yet another head was emerging . . . and

this head, gray as a smoky statue, was a woman’s. ...

Harry, both arms shaking now as he fought to keep

his wand still, saw her drop to the ground and

straighten up like the others, staring. ...

The shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle

before her with wide eyes.

“Don’t let go, now!” she cried, and her voice echoed

like Cedric’s as though from very far away. “Don’t let

him get you, Harry — don’t let go!”

She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace

around the inner walls of the golden web, while the

Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it ... and

Voldemort’s dead victims whispered as they circled

the duelers, whispered words of encouragement to

Harry, and hissed words Harry couldn’t hear to

Voldemort.

And now another head was emerging from the tip of

Voldemort’s wand ... and Harry knew when he saw it

who it would be ... he knew, as though he had

expected it from the moment when Cedric had

appeared from the wand . . . knew, because the woman

was the one he’d thought of more than any other

tonight. ...

The smoky shadow of a young woman with long hair

fell to the ground as Bertha had done, straightened

up, and looked at him ... and Harry, his arms shaking

madly now, looked back into the ghostly face of his

mother.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Your father’s coming ...” she said quietly. “Hold on

for your father ... it will be all right ... hold on. ...”

And he came . . . first his head, then his body . . . tall

and untidy-haired like Harry, the smoky, shadowy

form of James Potter blossomed from the end of

Voldemort’s wand, fell to the ground, and

straightened like his wife. He walked close to Harry,

looking down at him, and he spoke in the same

distant, echoing voice as the others, but quietly, so

that Voldemort, his face now livid with fear as his

victims prowled around him, could not hear. . . .

“When the connection is broken, we will linger for

only moments . . . but we will give you time . . . you

must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts

... do you understand, Harry?”

“Yes,” Harry gasped, fighting now to keep a hold on

his wand, which was slipping and sliding beneath his

fingers.

“Harry ...” whispered the figure of Cedric, “take my

body back, will you? Take my body back to my

parents. ...”

“I will,” said Harry, his face screwed up with the effort

of holding the wand.

“Do it now,” whispered his father’s voice, “be ready to

run ... do it now. ...”

“NOW!” Harry yelled; he didn’t think he could have

held on for another moment anyway — he pulled his

wand upward with an almighty wrench, and the

golden thread broke; the cage of light vanished, the

phoenix song died — but the shadowy figures of

Voldemort’s victims did not disappear — they were

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

closing in upon Voldemort, shielding Harry from his

gaze —

And Harry ran as he had never run in his life,

knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he

passed; he zigzagged behind headstones, feeling their

curses following him, hearing them hit the

headstones — he was dodging curses and graves,

pelting toward Cedric’s body, no longer aware of the

pain in his leg, his whole being concentrated on what

he had to do —

“Stun him\” he heard Voldemort scream.

Ten feet from Cedric, Harry dived behind a marble

angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of

its wing shatter as the spells hit it. Gripping his wand

more tightly, he dashed out from behind the angel —

“Impedimental” he bellowed, pointing his wand wildly

over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him.

From a muffled yell, he thought he had stopped at

least one of them, but there was no time to stop and

look; he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard

more wand blasts behind him; more jets of light flew

over his head as he fell, stretching out his hand to

grab Cedric’s arm —

“Stand aside! I will kill him! He is mine!” shrieked

Voldemort.

Harry’s hand had closed on Cedric’s wrist; one

tombstone stood between him and Voldemort, but

Cedric was too heavy to carry, and the cup was out of

reach —

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Voldemort’s red eyes flamed in the darkness. Harry

saw his mouth curl into a smile, saw him raise his

wand.

“Acciol” Harry yelled, pointing his wand at the

Triwizard Cup.

It flew into the air and soared toward him. Harry

caught it by the handle —

He heard Voldemort’s scream of fury at the same

moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that

meant the Portkey had worked — it was speeding him

away in a whirl of wind and color, and Cedric along

with him. ... They were going back.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

VERITASERUM

Harry felt himself slam flat into the ground; his face

was pressed into grass; the smell of it filled his

nostrils. He had closed his eyes while the Portkey

transported him, and he kept them closed now. He

did not move. All the breath seemed to have been

knocked out of him; his head was swimming so badly

he felt as though the ground beneath him were

swaying like the deck of a ship. To hold himself

steady, he tightened his hold on the two things he

was still clutching: the smooth, cold handle of the Tri-

wizard Cup and Cedric’s body. He felt as though he

would slide away into the blackness gathering at the

edges of his brain if he let go of either of them. Shock

and exhaustion kept him on the ground, breathing in

the smell of the grass, waiting ... waiting for someone

to do something . . . something to happen . . . and all

the while, his scar burned dully on his forehead. ...

A torrent of sound deafened and confused him; there

were voices everywhere, footsteps, screams. ... He

remained where he was, his face screwed up against

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

the noise, as though it were a nightmare that would

pass. ...

Then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned

him over.

“Harry! HarryV’

He opened his eyes.

He was looking up at the starry sky, and Albus

Dumbledore was crouched over him. The dark

shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around

them, pushing nearer; Harry felt the ground beneath

his head reverberating with their footsteps.

He had come back to the edge of the maze. He could

see the stands rising above him, the shapes of people

moving in them, the stars above.

Harry let go of the cup, but he clutched Cedric to him

even more tightly. He raised his free hand and seized

Dumbledore ’s wrist, while Dumbledore ’s face swam in

and out of focus.

“He’s back,” Harry whispered. “He’s back. Voldemort.”

“What’s going on? What’s happened?”

The face of Cornelius Fudge appeared upside down

over Harry; it looked white, appalled.

“My God — Diggory!” it whispered. “Dumbledore —

he’s dead!”

The words were repeated, the shadowy figures

pressing in on them gasped it to those around them

. . . and then others shouted it — screeched it — into

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

the night — “He’s dead!” “He’s dead!” “Cedric Diggory!

Dead).”

“Harry, let go of him,” he heard Fudge’s voice say, and

he felt fingers trying to pry him from Cedric’s limp

body, but Harry wouldn’t let him go. Then

Dumbledore’s face, which was still blurred and

misted, came closer.

“Harry, you can’t help him now. It’s over. Let go.”

“He wanted me to bring him back,” Harry muttered —

it seemed important to explain this. “He wanted me to

bring him back to his parents. ...”

“That’s right, Harry ... just let go now. ...”

Dumbledore bent down, and with extraordinary

strength for a man so old and thin, raised Harry from

the ground and set him on his feet. Harry swayed. His

head was pounding. His injured leg would no longer

support his weight. The crowd around them jostled,

fighting to get closer, pressing darkly in on him —

“What’s happened?” “What’s wrong with him?”

“Dig gory’s dead\”

“He’ll need to go to the hospital wing!” Fudge was

saying loudly. “He’s ill, he’s injured — Dumbledore,

Diggory’s parents, they’re here, they’re in the stands.

“I’ll take Harry, Dumbledore, I’ll take him — ”

“No, I would prefer — ”

“Dumbledore, Amos Diggory’s running ... he’s coming

over. ... Don’t you think you should tell him — before

he sees — ?”

 

“Harry, stay here — ”

Girls were screaming, sobbing hysterically. . . . The

scene flickered oddly before Harry’s eyes. ...

“It’s all right, son, I’ve got you ... come on ... hospital

wing ...”

“Dumbledore said stay,” said Harry thickly, the

pounding in his scar making him feel as though he

was about to throw up; his vision was blurring worse

than ever.

“You need to lie down. ... Come on now. ...”

Someone larger and stronger than he was was half

pulling, half carrying him through the frightened

crowd. Harry heard people gasping, screaming, and

shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path

through them, taking him back to the castle. Across

the lawn, past the lake and the Durmstrang ship,

Harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the

man helping him walk.

“What happened, Harry?” the man asked at last as he

lifted Harry up the stone steps. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk.

It was Mad-Eye Moody.

“Cup was a Portkey,” said Harry as they crossed the

entrance hall. “Took me and Cedric to a graveyard ...

and Voldemort was there ... Lord Voldemort ...”

Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Up the marble stairs ...

“The Dark Lord was there? What happened then?”

“Killed Cedric ... they killed Cedric. ...”

“And then?”

 

Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Along the corridor . . .

“Made a potion ... got his body back. ...”

“The Dark Lord got his body back? He’s returned?”

“And the Death Eaters came ... and then we dueled.

“You dueled with the Dark Lord?”

“Got away . . . my wand . . . did something funny. ... I

saw my mum and dad ... they came out of his wand.

“In here, Harry ... in here, and sit down. ... You’ll be

all right now ... drink this. ...”

Harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup

being pushed into his hands.

“Drink it ... you’ll feel better ... come on, now, Harry, I

need to know exactly what happened. ...”

Moody helped tip the stuff down Harry’s throat; he

coughed, a peppery taste burning his throat. Moody’s

office came into sharper focus, and so did Moody

himself. ... He looked as white as Fudge had looked,

and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon Harry’s

face.

“Voldemort’s back, Harry? You’re sure he’s back? How

did he do it?”

“He took stuff from his father’s grave, and from

Wormtail, and me,” said Harry. His head felt clearer;

his scar wasn’t hurting so badly; he could now see

Moody’s face distinctly, even though the office was

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

dark. He could still hear screaming and shouting

from the distant Quidditch field.

“What did the Dark Lord take from you?” said Moody.

“Blood,” said Harry, raising his arm. His sleeve was

ripped where Wormtail’s dagger had torn it.

Moody let out his breath in a long, low hiss.

“And the Death Eaters? They returned?”

“Yes,” said Harry. “Loads of them ...”

“How did he treat them?” Moody asked quietly. “Did

he forgive them?”

But Harry had suddenly remembered. He should have

told Dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway

“There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There’s a Death

Eater here — they put my name in the Goblet of Fire,

they made sure I got through to the end — ”

Harry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back

down.

“I know who the Death Eater is,” he said quietly.

“Karkaroff?” said Harry wildly. “Where is he? Have

you got him? Is he locked up?”

“Karkaroff?” said Moody with an odd laugh.

“Karkaroff fled tonight, when he felt the Dark Mark

burn upon his arm. He betrayed too many faithful

supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them . . .

but I doubt he will get far. The Dark Lord has ways of

tracking his enemies.”

 

“Karkaroff’s gone? He ran away? But then — he didn’t

put my name in the goblet?”

“No,” said Moody slowly. “No, he didn’t. It was I who

did that.”

Harry heard, but didn’t believe.

“No, you didn’t,” he said. “You didn’t do that ... you

can’t have done ...”

“I assure you I did,” said Moody, and his magical eye

swung around and fixed upon the door, and Harry

knew he was making sure that there was no one

outside it. At the same time, Moody drew out his

wand and pointed it at Harry.

“He forgave them, then?” he said. “The Death Eaters

who went free? The ones who escaped Azkaban?”

“What?” said Harry.

He was looking at the wand Moody was pointing at

him. This was a bad joke, it had to be.

“I asked you,” said Moody quietly, “whether he forgave

the scum who never even went to look for him. Those

treacherous cowards who wouldn’t even brave

Azkaban for him. The faithless, worthless bits of filth

who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the

Quidditch World Cup, but fled at the sight of the Dark

Mark when I fired it into the sky.”

“ You fired . . . What are you talking about ... ?”

“I told you, Harry ... I told you. If there’s one thing I

hate more than any other, it’s a Death Eater who

walked free. They turned their backs on my master

when he needed them most. I expected him to punish

 

them. I expected him to torture them. Tell me he hurt

them, Harry. ...” Moody’s face was suddenly lit with

an insane smile. “Tell me he told them that I, I alone

remained faithful . . . prepared to risk everything to

deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all ...

you.”

“You didn’t ... it — it can’t be you. ...”

“Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire, under the

name of a different school? I did. Who frightened off

every person I thought might try to hurt you or

prevent you from winning the tournament? I did. Who

nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons? I did.

Who helped you see the only way you could beat the

dragon? I did.”

Moody’s magical eye had now left the door. It was

fixed upon Harry. His lopsided mouth leered more

widely than ever.

“It hasn’t been easy, Harry, guiding you through these

tasks without arousing suspicion. I have had to use

every ounce of cunning I possess, so that my hand

would not be detectable in your success. Dumbledore

would have been very suspicious if you had managed

everything too easily. As long as you got into that

maze, preferably with a decent head start — then, I

knew, I would have a chance of getting rid of the

other champions and leaving your way clear. But I

also had to contend with your stupidity. The second

task . . . that was when I was most afraid we would

fail. I was keeping watch on you, Potter. I knew you

hadn’t worked out the egg’s clue, so I had to give you

another hint — ”

“You didn’t,” Harry said hoarsely. “Cedric gave me the

clue — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Who told Cedric to open it underwater? I did. I

trusted that he would pass the information on to you.

Decent people are so easy to manipulate, Potter. I was

sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him

about the dragons, and so he did. But even then,

Potter, even then you seemed likely to fail. I was

watching all the time ... all those hours in the library.

Didn’t you realize that the book you needed was in

your dormitory all along? I planted it there early on, I

gave it to the Longbottom boy, don’t you remember?

Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. It would

have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed.

I expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could

for help. Longbottom would have told you in an

instant. But you did not ... you did not. ... You have a

streak of pride and independence that might have

ruined all.

“So what could I do? Feed you information from

another innocent source. You told me at the Yule Ball

a house-elf called Dobby had given you a Christmas

present. I called the elf to the staffroom to collect

some robes for cleaning. I staged a loud conversation

with Professor McGonagall about the hostages who

had been taken, and whether Potter would think to

use gillyweed. And your little elf friend ran straight to

Snape’s office and then hurried to find you. ...”

Moody’s wand was still pointing directly at Harry’s

heart. Over his shoulder, foggy shapes were moving in

the Foe-Glass on the wall.

“You were so long in that lake, Potter, I thought you

had drowned. But luckily, Dumbledore took your

idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it. I

breathed again.

“You had an easier time of it than you should have in

that maze tonight, of course,” said Moody. “I was

 

patrolling around it, able to see through the outer

hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of your way.

I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed. I put the

Imperius Curse on Krum, so that he would finish

Diggory and leave your path to the cup clear.”

Harry stared at Moody. He just didn’t see how this

could be. ... Dumbledore’s friend, the famous Auror

. . . the one who had caught so many Death Eaters . . .

It made no sense ... no sense at all. ...

The foggy shapes in the Foe-Glass were sharpening,

had become more distinct. Harry could see the

outlines of three people over Moody’s shoulder,

moving closer and closer. But Moody wasn’t watching

them. His magical eye was upon Harry.

“The Dark Lord didn’t manage to kill you, Potter, and

he so wanted to,” whispered Moody. “Imagine how he

will reward me when he finds I have done it for him. I

gave you to him — the thing he needed above all to

regenerate — and then I killed you for him. I will be

honored beyond all other Death Eaters. I will be his

dearest, his closest supporter ... closer than a son. ...”

Moody’s normal eye was bulging, the magical eye

fixed upon Harry. The door was barred, and Harry

knew he would never reach his own wand in time. ...

“The Dark Lord and I,” said Moody, and he looked

completely insane now, towering over Harry, leering

down at him, “have much in common. Both of us, for

instance, had very disappointing fathers ... very

disappointing indeed. Both of us suffered the

indignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers.

And both of us had the pleasure . . . the very great

pleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the

continued rise of the Dark Order!”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You’re mad,” Harry said — he couldn’t stop himself

— “you’re mad!”

“Mad, am I?” said Moody, his voice rising

uncontrollably. “We’ll see! We’ll see who’s mad, now

that the Dark Lord has returned, with me at his side!

He is back, Harry Potter, you did not conquer him —

and now — I conquer you!”

Moody raised his wand, he opened his mouth; Harry

plunged his own hand into his robes —

“Stupefy\” There was a blinding flash of red light, and

with a great splintering and crashing, the door of

Moody’s office was blasted apart —

Moody was thrown backward onto the office floor.

Harry, still staring at the place where Moody’s face

had been, saw Albus Dumbledore, Professor Snape,

and Professor McGonagall looking back at him out of

the Foe-Glass. He looked around and saw the three of

them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front,

his wand outstretched.

At that moment, Harry fully understood for the first

time why people said Dumbledore was the only wizard

Voldemort had ever feared. The look upon

Dumbledore ’s face as he stared down at the

unconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more

terrible than Harry could have ever imagined. There

was no benign smile upon Dumbledore ’s face, no

twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There was

cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of

power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were

giving off burning heat.

He stepped into the office, placed a foot underneath

Moody’s unconscious body, and kicked him over onto

his back, so that his face was visible. Snape followed

 

him, looking into the Foe-Glass, where his own face

was still visible, glaring into the room. Professor

McGonagall went straight to Harry.

“Come along, Potter,” she whispered. The thin line of

her mouth was twitching as though she was about to

cry. “Come along ... hospital wing ...”

“No,” said Dumbledore sharply.

“Dumbledore, he ought to — look at him — he’s been

through enough tonight — ”

“He will stay, Minerva, because he needs to

understand,” said Dumbledore curtly. “Understanding

is the first step to acceptance, and only with

acceptance can there be recovery. He needs to know

who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered

tonight, and why.”

“Moody,” Harry said. He was still in a state of

complete disbelief. “How can it have been Moody?”

“This is not Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore quietly.

“You have never known Alastor Moody. The real

Moody would not have removed you from my sight

after what happened tonight. The moment he took

you, I knew — and I followed.”

Dumbledore bent down over Moody’s limp form and

put a hand inside his robes. He pulled out Moody’s

hip flask and a set of keys on a ring. Then he turned

to Professors McGonagall and Snape.

“Severus, please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion

you possess, and then go down to the kitchens and

bring up the house-elf called Winky. Minerva, kindly

go down to Hagrid’s house, where you will find a large

black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch. Take the dog

 

up to my office, tell him I will be with him shortly,

then come back here.”

If either Snape or McGonagall found these

instructions peculiar, they hid their confusion. Both

turned at once and left the office. Dumbledore walked

over to the trunk with seven locks, fitted the first key

in the lock, and opened it. It contained a mass of

spell-books. Dumbledore closed the trunk, placed a

second key in the second lock, and opened the trunk

again. The spellbooks had vanished; this time it

contained an assortment of broken Sneako-scopes,

some parchment and quills, and what looked like a

silvery Invisibility Cloak. Harry watched, astounded,

as Dumbledore placed the third, fourth, fifth, and

sixth keys in their respective locks, reopening the

trunk, and each time revealing different contents.

Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw

open the lid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement.

He was looking down into a kind of pit, an

underground room, and lying on the floor some ten

feet below, apparently fast asleep, thin and starved in

appearance, was the real Mad-Eye Moody. His

wooden leg was gone, the socket that should have

held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid,

and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing. Harry

stared, thunderstruck, between the sleeping Moody in

the trunk and the unconscious Moody lying on the

floor of the office.

Dumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself,

and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping

Moody. He bent over him.

“Stunned — controlled by the Imperius Curse — very

weak,” he said. “Of course, they would have needed to

keep him alive. Harry, throw down the imposter’s

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

cloak — he’s freezing. Madam Pomfrey will need to see

him, but he seems in no immediate danger.”

Harry did as he was told; Dumbledore covered Moody

in the cloak, tucked it around him, and clambered

out of the trunk again. Then he picked up the hip

flask that stood upon the desk, unscrewed it, and

turned it over. A thick glutinous liquid splattered onto

the office floor.

“Polyjuice Potion, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “You see

the simplicity of it, and the brilliance. For Moody

never does drink except from his hip flask, he’s well

known for it. The imposter needed, of course, to keep

the real Moody close by, so that he could continue

making the potion. You see his hair ...” Dumbledore

looked down on the Moody in the trunk. “The

imposter has been cutting it off all year, see where it

is uneven? But I think, in the excitement of tonight,

our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as

frequently as he should have done ... on the hour . . .

every hour. ... We shall see.”

Dumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat

down upon it, his eyes fixed upon the unconscious

Moody on the floor. Harry stared at him too. Minutes

passed in silence. ...

Then, before Harry’s very eyes, the face of the man on

the floor began to change. The scars were

disappearing, the skin was becoming smooth; the

mangled nose became whole and started to shrink.

The long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing

into the scalp and turning the color of straw.

Suddenly, with a loud clunk, the wooden leg fell away

as a normal leg regrew in its place; next moment, the

magical eyeball had popped out of the man’s face as a

real eye replaced it; it rolled away across the floor and

continued to swivel in every direction.

 

Harry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned,

slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair. He knew who

he was. He had seen him in Dumbledore’s Pensieve,

had watched him being led away from court by the

dementors, trying to convince Mr. Crouch that he was

innocent . . . but he was lined around the eyes now

and looked much older. . . .

There were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor.

Snape had returned with Winky at his heels.

Professor McGonagall was right behind them.

“Crouch!” Snape said, stopping dead in the doorway.

“Barty Crouch!”

“Good heavens,” said Professor McGonagall, stopping

dead and staring down at the man on the floor.

Filthy, disheveled, Winky peered around Snape’s legs.

Her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing

shriek.

“Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?”

She flung herself forward onto the young man’s chest.

“You is killed him! You is killed him! You is killed

Master’s son!”

“He is simply Stunned, Winky,” said Dumbledore.

“Step aside, please. Severus, you have the potion?”

Snape handed Dumbledore a small glass bottle of

completely clear liquid: the Veritaserum with which

he had threatened Harry in class. Dumbledore got up,

bent over the man on the floor, and pulled him into a

sitting position against the wall beneath the Foe-

Glass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape,

and McGonagall were still glaring down upon them

 

all. Winky remained on her knees, trembling, her

hands over her face. Dumbledore forced the man’s

mouth open and poured three drops inside it. Then

he pointed his wand at the man’s chest and said,

“Rennervate.”

Crouch’s son opened his eyes. His face was slack, his

gaze unfocused. Dumbledore knelt before him, so that

their faces were level.

“Can you hear me?” Dumbledore asked quietly.

The man’s eyelids flickered.

“Yes,” he muttered.

“I would like you to tell us,” said Dumbledore softly,

“how you came to be here. How did you escape from

Azkaban?”

Crouch took a deep, shuddering breath, then began

to speak in a flat, expressionless voice.

“My mother saved me. She knew she was dying. She

persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to

her. He loved her as he had never loved me. He

agreed. They came to visit me. They gave me a draft of

Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother’s hairs.

She took a draft of Polyjuice Potion containing one of

my hairs. We took on each other’s appearance.”

Winky was shaking her head, trembling.

“Say no more, Master Barty, say no more, you is

getting your father into trouble!”

But Crouch took another deep breath and continued

in the same flat voice.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy,

one dying person entering Azkaban. They sensed one

healthy, one dying person leaving it. My father

smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case

any prisoners were watching through their doors.

“My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban.

She was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the

end. She was buried under my name and bearing my

appearance. Everyone believed her to be me.”

The man’s eyelids flickered.

“And what did your father do with you, when he had

got you home?” said Dumbledore quietly.

“Staged my mother’s death. A quiet, private funeral.

That grave is empty. The house-elf nursed me back to

health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be

controlled. My father had to use a number of spells to

subdue me. When I had recovered my strength, I

thought only of finding my master ... of returning to

his service.”

“How did your father subdue you?” said Dumbledore.

“The Imperius Curse,” Crouch said. “I was under my

father’s control. I was forced to wear an Invisibility

Cloak day and night. I was always with the house-elf.

She was my keeper and caretaker. She pitied me. She

persuaded my father to give me occasional treats.

Rewards for my good behavior.”

“Master Barty, Master Barty,” sobbed Winky through

her hands. “You isn’t ought to tell them, we is getting

in trouble. ...”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive?”

said Dumbledore softly. “Did anyone know except

your father and the house-elf?”

“Yes,” said Crouch, his eyelids flickering again. “A

witch in my father’s office. Bertha Jorkins. She came

to the house with papers for my father’s signature. He

was not at home. Winky showed her inside and

returned to the kitchen, to me. But Bertha Jorkins

heard Winky talking to me. She came to investigate.

She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the

Invisibility Cloak. My father arrived home. She

confronted him. He put a very powerful Memory

Charm on her to make her forget what she’d found

out. Too powerful. He said it damaged her memory

permanently.”

“Why is she coming to nose into my master’s private

business?” sobbed Winky. “Why isn’t she leaving us

be?”

“Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup,” said

Dumbledore.

“Winky talked my father into it,” said Crouch, still in

the same monotonous voice. “She spent months

persuading him. I had not left the house for years. I

had loved Quidditch. Let him go, she said. He will be

in his Invisibility Cloak. He can watch. Let him smell

fresh air for once. She said my mother would have

wanted it. She told my father that my mother had

died to give me freedom. She had not saved me for a

life of imprisonment. He agreed in the end.

“It was carefully planned. My father led me and Winky

up to the Top Box early in the day. Winky was to say

that she was saving a seat for my father. I was to sit

there, invisible. When everyone had left the box, we

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

would emerge. Winky would appear to be alone.

Nobody would ever know.

“But Winky didn’t know that I was growing stronger. I

was starting to fight my father’s Imperius Curse.

There were times when I was almost myself again.

There were brief periods when I seemed outside his

control. It happened, there, in the Top Box. It was like

waking from a deep sleep. I found myself out in

public, in the middle of the match, and I saw, in front

of me, a wand sticking out of a boy’s pocket. I had not

been allowed a wand since before Azkaban. I stole it.

Winky didn’t know. Winky is frightened of heights.

She had her face hidden.”

“Master Barty, you bad boy!” whispered Winky, tears

trickling between her fingers.

“So you took the wand,” said Dumbledore, “and what

did you do with it?”

“We went back to the tent,” said Crouch. “Then we

heard them. We heard the Death Eaters. The ones

who had never been to Azkaban. The ones who had

never suffered for my master. They had turned their

backs on him. They were not enslaved, as I was. They

were free to seek him, but they did not. They were

merely making sport of Muggles. The sound of their

voices awoke me. My mind was clearer than it had

been in years. I was angry. I had the wand. I wanted

to attack them for their disloyalty to my master. My

father had left the tent; he had gone to free the

Muggles. Winky was afraid to see me so angry. She

used her own brand of magic to bind me to her. She

pulled me from the tent, pulled me into the forest,

away from the Death Eaters. I tried to hold her back. I

wanted to return to the campsite. I wanted to show

those Death Eaters what loyalty to the Dark Lord

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

meant, and to punish them for their lack of it. I used

the stolen wand to cast the Dark Mark into the sky.

“Ministry wizards arrived. They shot Stunning Spells

everywhere. One of the spells came through the trees

where Winky and I stood. The bond connecting us

was broken. We were both Stunned.

“When Winky was discovered, my father knew I must

be nearby. He searched the bushes where she had

been found and felt me lying there. He waited until

the other Ministry members had left the forest. He put

me back under the Imperius Curse and took me

home. He dismissed Winky. She had failed him. She

had let me acquire a wand. She had almost let me

escape.”

Winky let out a wail of despair.

“Now it was just Father and I, alone in the house. And

then ... and then ...” Crouch’s head rolled on his

neck, and an insane grin spread across his face. “My

master came for me.

“He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of

his servant Wormtail. My master had found out that I

was still alive. He had captured Bertha Jorkins in

Albania. He had tortured her. She told him a great

deal. She told him about the Triwizard Tournament.

She told him the old Auror, Moody, was going to teach

at Hogwarts. He tortured her until he broke through

the Memory Charm my father had placed upon her.

She told him I had escaped from Azkaban. She told

him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from

seeking my master. And so my master knew that I

was still his faithful servant — perhaps the most

faithful of all. My master conceived a plan, based

upon the information Bertha had given him. He

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

needed me. He arrived at our house near midnight.

My father answered the door.”

The smile spread wider over Crouch’s face, as though

recalling the sweetest memory of his life. Winky’s

petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers.

She seemed too appalled to speak.

“It was very quick. My father was placed under the

Imperius Curse by my master. Now my father was the

one imprisoned, controlled. My master forced him to

go about his business as usual, to act as though

nothing was wrong. And I was released. I awoke. I

was myself again, alive as I hadn’t been in years.”

“And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do?” said

Dumbledore.

“He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything

for him. I was ready. It was my dream, my greatest

ambition, to serve him, to prove myself to him. He

told me he needed to place a faithful servant at

Hogwarts. A servant who would guide Harry Potter

through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing

to do so. A servant who would watch over Harry

Potter. Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup. Turn

the cup into a Portkey, which would take the first

person to touch it to my master. But first — ”

“You needed Alastor Moody,” said Dumbledore. His

blue eyes were blazing, though his voice remained

calm.

“Wormtail and I did it. We had prepared the Polyjuice

Potion beforehand. We journeyed to his house. Moody

put up a struggle. There was a commotion. We

managed to subdue him just in time. Forced him into

a compartment of his own magical trunk. Took some

of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I

 

became Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I

was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to

sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance. I

made the dustbins move around the yard. I told

Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard,

who had set off the dustbins. Then I packed up

Moody’s clothes and Dark detectors, put them in the

trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept

him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be

able to question him. To find out about his past, learn

his habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore. I

also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion. The

other ingredients were easy. I stole boom-slang skin

from the dungeons. When the Potions master found

me in his office, I said I was under orders to search

it.”

“And what became of Wormtail after you attacked

Moody?” said Dumbledore.

“Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my

father’s house, and to keep watch over my father.”

“But your father escaped,” said Dumbledore.

“Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius

Curse just as I had done. There were periods when he

knew what was happening. My master decided it was

no longer safe for my father to leave the house. He

forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He

made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail

neglected his duty. He was not watchful enough. My

father escaped. My master guessed that he was

heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to tell

Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to

admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.

“My master sent me word of my father’s escape. He

told me to stop him at all costs. So I waited and

 

watched. I used the map I had taken from Harry

Potter. The map that had almost mined everything.”

“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”

“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter

saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice

Potion from Snape’s office one night. He thought I was

my father. We have the same first name. I took the

map from Potter that night. I told him my father

hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was

after Snape.

“For a week I waited for my father to arrive at

Hogwarts. At last, one evening, the map showed my

father entering the grounds. I pulled on my Invisibility

Cloak and went down to meet him. He was walking

around the edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and

Krum. I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my master

needed him. Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned

Krum. I killed my father.”

“iVoooo!” wailed Winky. “Master Barty, Master Barty,

what is you saying?”

“You killed your father,” Dumbledore said, in the

same soft voice. “What did you do with the body?”

“Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the

Invisibility Cloak. I had the map with me. I watched

Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore

joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore

out of the castle. I walked back out of the forest,

doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I

told Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come.

“Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I

went back to my father’s body. Watched the map.

When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my father’s

 

body. He became a bone ... I buried it, while wearing

the Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front

of Hagrid’s cabin.”

There was complete silence now, except for Winky’s

continued sobs. Then Dumbledore said, “And tonight

“I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze

before dinner,” whispered Barty Crouch. “Turned it

into a Portkey. My master’s plan worked. He is

returned to power and I will be honored by him

beyond the dreams of wizards.”

The insane smile lit his features once more, and his

head drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and

sobbed at his side.

THE PARTING OF THE WAYS

Dumbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty

Crouch for a moment with disgust on his face. Then

he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it,

ropes that twisted themselves around Barty Crouch,

binding him tightly. He turned to Professor

McGonagall.

“Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I

take Harry upstairs?”

“Of course,” said Professor McGonagall. She looked

slightly nauseous, as though she had just watched

someone being sick. However, when she drew out her

wand and pointed it at Barty Crouch, her hand was

quite steady.

“Severus” — Dumbledore turned to Snape — “please

tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here; we need to

get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing. Then go

down into the grounds, find Cornelius Fudge, and

bring him up to this office. He will undoubtedly want

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

to question Crouch himself. Tell him I will be in the

hospital wing in half an hour’s time if he needs me.”

Snape nodded silently and swept out of the room.

“Harry?” Dumbledore said gently.

Harry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg,

which he had not noticed all the time he had been

listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He

also realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore

gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark

corridor.

“I want you to come up to my office first, Harry,” he

said quietly as they headed up the passageway.

“Sirius is waiting for us there.”

Harry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of

complete unreality were upon him, but he did not

care; he was even glad of it. He didn’t want to have to

think about anything that had happened since he had

first touched the Triwizard Cup. He didn’t want to

have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as

photographs, which kept flashing across his mind.

Mad-Eye Moody, inside the trunk. Wormtail, slumped

on the ground, cradling his stump of an arm.

Voldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron. Cedric

. . . dead . . . Cedric, asking to be returned to his

parents. ...

“Professor,” Harry mumbled, “where are Mr. and Mrs.

Diggory?”

“They are with Professor Sprout,” said Dumbledore.

His voice, which had been so calm throughout the

interrogation of Barty Crouch, shook very slightly for

the first time. “She was Head of Cedric’s house, and

knew him best.”

 

They had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore

gave the password, it sprang aside, and he and Harry

went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door.

Dumbledore pushed it open. Sirius was standing

there. His face was white and gaunt as it had been

when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment,

he had crossed the room.

“Harry, are you all right? I knew it — I knew

something like this — what happened?”

His hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in

front of the desk.

“What happened?” he asked more urgently.

Dumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty

Crouch had said. Harry was only half listening. So

tired every bone in his body was aching, he wanted

nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, for hours

and hours, until he fell asleep and didn’t have to

think or feel anymore.

There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix

had left his perch, flown across the office, and landed

on Harry’s knee.

“ ’Lo, Fawkes,” said Harry quietly. He stroked the

phoenix’s beautiful scarlet-and-gold plumage. Fawkes

blinked peacefully up at him. There was something

comforting about his warm weight.

Dumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite

Harry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who

avoided his eyes. Dumbledore was going to question

him. He was going to make Harry relive everything.

“I need to know what happened after you touched the

Portkey in the maze, Harry,” said Dumbledore.

 

“We can leave that till morning, can’t we,

Dumbledore?” said Sirius harshly. He had put a hand

on Harry’s shoulder. “Let him have a sleep. Let him

rest.”

Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but

Dumbledore took no notice of Sirius’s words. He

leaned forward toward Harry. Very unwillingly, Harry

raised his head and looked into those blue eyes.

“If I thought I could help you,” Dumbledore said

gently, “by putting you into an enchanted sleep and

allowing you to postpone the moment when you

would have to think about what has happened

tonight, I would do it. But I know better. Numbing the

pain for a while will make it worse when you finally

feel it. You have shown bravery beyond anything I

could have expected of you. I ask you to demonstrate

your courage one more time. I ask you to tell us what

happened.”

The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It

shivered in the air, and Harry felt as though a drop of

hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his

stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.

He took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he

spoke, visions of everything that had passed that

night seemed to rise before his eyes; he saw the

sparkling surface of the potion that had revived

Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating

between the graves around them; he saw Cedric’s

body, lying on the ground beside the cup.

Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to

say something, his hand still tight on Harry’s

shoulder, but Dumbledore raised his hand to stop

him, and Harry was glad of this, because it was easier

to keep going now he had started. It was even a relief;

 

he felt almost as though something poisonous were

being extracted from him. It was costing him every bit

of determination he had to keep talking, yet he sensed

that once he had finished, he would feel better.

When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with

the dagger, however, Sirius let out a vehement

exclamation and Dumbledore stood up so quickly that

Harry started. Dumbledore walked around the desk

and told Harry to stretch out his arm. Harry showed

them both the place where his robes were torn and

the cut beneath them.

“He said my blood would make him stronger than if

he’d used someone else’s,” Harry told Dumbledore.

“He said the protection my — my mother left in me —

he’d have it too. And he was right — he could touch

me without hurting himself, he touched my face.”

For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam

of something like triumph in Dumbledore ’s eyes. But

next second, Harry was sure he had imagined it, for

when Dumbledore had returned to his seat behind

the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry had

ever seen him.

“Very well,” he said, sitting down again. “Voldemort

has overcome that particular barrier. Harry, continue,

please.”

Harry went on; he explained how Voldemort had

emerged from the cauldron, and told them all he

could remember of Voldemort’s speech to the Death

Eaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him,

returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.

But when he reached the part where the golden beam

of light had connected his and Voldemort’s wands, he

found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking,

 

but the memories of what had come out of

Voldemort’s wand were flooding into his mind. He

could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha

Jorkins ... his father ... his mother ...

He was glad when Sirius broke the silence.

“The wands connected?” he said, looking from Harry

to Dumbledore. “Why?”

Harry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face

there was an arrested look.

“Priori Incantatem,” he muttered.

His eyes gazed into Harry’s and it was almost as

though an invisible beam of understanding shot

between them.

“The Reverse Spell effect?” said Sirius sharply.

“Exactly,” said Dumbledore. “Harry’s wand and

Voldemort’s wand share cores. Each of them contains

a feather from the tail of the same phoenix. This

phoenix, in fact,” he added, and he pointed at the

scarlet-and-gold bird, perching peacefully on Harry’s

knee.

“My wand’s feather came from Fawkes?” Harry said,

amazed.

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell

me you had bought the second wand, the moment

you left his shop four years ago.”

“So what happens when a wand meets its brother?”

said Sirius.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“They will not work properly against each other,” said

Dumbledore. “If, however, the owners of the wands

force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will

take place. One of the wands will force the other to

regurgitate spells it has performed — in reverse. The

most recent first ... and then those which preceded it.

He looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.

“Which means,” said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes

upon Harry’s face, “that some form of Cedric must

have reappeared.”

Harry nodded again.

“Diggory came back to life?” said Sirius sharply.

“No spell can reawaken the dead,” said Dumbledore

heavily. “All that would have happened is a kind of

reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would

have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?”

“He spoke to me,” Harry said. He was suddenly

shaking again. “The ... the ghost Cedric, or whatever

he was, spoke.”

“An echo,” said Dumbledore, “which retained Cedric’s

appearance and character. I am guessing other such

forms appeared ... less recent victims of Voldemort’s

wand. ...”

“An old man,” Harry said, his throat still constricted.

“Bertha Jorkins. And ...”

“Your parents?” said Dumbledore quietly.

“Yes,” said Harry.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Sirius’s grip on Harry’s shoulder was now so tight it

was painful.

“The last murders the wand performed,” said

Dumbledore, nodding. “In reverse order. More would

have appeared, of course, had you maintained the

connection. Very well, Harry, these echoes, these

shadows . . . what did they do?”

Harry described how the figures that had emerged

from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden

web, how Voldemort had seemed to fear them, how

the shadow of Harry’s father had told him what to do,

how Cedric’s had made its final request.

At this point, Harry found he could not continue. He

looked around at Sirius and saw that he had his face

in his hands.

Harry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left

his knee. The phoenix had fluttered to the floor. It

was resting its beautiful head against Harry’s injured

leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from its eyes

onto the wound left by the spider. The pain vanished.

The skin mended. His leg was repaired.

“I will say it again,” said Dumbledore as the phoenix

rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch

beside the door. “You have shown bravery beyond

anything I could have expected of you tonight, Harry.

You have shown bravery equal to those who died

fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers. You

have shouldered a grown wizard’s burden and found

yourself equal to it — and you have now given us all

that we have a right to expect. You will come with me

to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to

the dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some

peace ... Sirius, would you like to stay with him?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Sirius nodded and stood up. He transformed back

into the great black dog and walked with Harry and

Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them

down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing.

When Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw

Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped

around a harassed-looking Madam Pomfrey. They

appeared to be demanding to know where Harry was

and what had happened to him. All of them whipped

around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog

entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled

scream.

“Harry! Oh Harry!”

She started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore

moved between them.

“Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to

me for a moment. Harry has been through a terrible

ordeal tonight. He has just had to relive it for me.

What he needs now is sleep, and peace, and quiet. If

he would like you all to stay with him,” he added,

looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, “you

may do so. But I do not want you questioning him

until he is ready to answer, and certainly not this

evening.”

Mrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She

rounded on Ron, Hermione, and Bill as though they

were being noisy, and hissed, “Did you hear? He

needs quiet!”

“Headmaster,” said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the

great black dog that was Sirius, “may I ask what — ?”

“This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,”

said Dumbledore simply. “I assure you, he is

 

extremely well trained. Harry — I will wait while you

get into bed.”

Harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to

Dumbledore for asking the others not to question

him. It wasn’t as though he didn’t want them there;

but the thought of explaining it all over again, the

idea of reliving it one more time, was more than he

could stand.

“I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with

Fudge, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I would like you to

remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the

school.” He left.

As Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he

caught sight of the real Moody lying motionless in a

bed at the far end of the room. His wooden leg and

magical eye were lying on the bedside table.

“Is he okay?” Harry asked.

“He’ll be fine,” said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry

some pajamas and pulling screens around him. He

took off his robes, pulled on the pajamas, and got into

bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs. Weasley, and the black

dog came around the screen and settled themselves

in chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione

were looking at him almost cautiously, as though

scared of him.

“I’m all right,” he told them. “Just tired.”

Mrs. Weasley’s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed

his bedcovers unnecessarily.

Madam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office,

returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion

and a goblet.

 

“You’ll need to drink all of this, Harry,” she said. “It’s

a potion for dreamless sleep.”

Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He

felt himself becoming drowsy at once. Everything

around him became hazy; the lamps around the

hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a

friendly way through the screen around his bed; his

body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the

warmth of the feather matress. Before he could finish

the potion, before he could say another word, his

exhaustion had carried him off to sleep.

Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he

didn’t open his eyes, wanting to drop off again. The

room was still dimly lit; he was sure it was still

nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn’t have

been asleep very long.

Then he heard whispering around him.

“They’ll wake him if they don’t shut up!”

“What are they shouting about? Nothing else can

have happened, can it?”

Harry opened his eyes blearily Someone had removed

his glasses. He could see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs.

Weasley and Bill close by. Mrs. Weasley was on her

feet.

“That’s Fudge’s voice,” she whispered. “And that’s

Minerva McGonagall’s, isn’t it? But what are they

arguing about?”

Now Harry could hear them too: people shouting and

running toward the hospital wing.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Regrettable, but all the same, Minerva — ” Cornelius

Fudge was saying loudly.

“You should never have brought it inside the castle!”

yelled Professor McGonagall. “When Dumbledore

finds out — ”

Harry heard the hospital doors burst open. Unnoticed

by any of the people around his bed, all of whom were

staring at the door as Bill pulled back the screens,

Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.

Fudge came striding up the ward. Professors

McGonagall and Snape were at his heels.

“Where’s Dumbledore?” Fudge demanded of Mrs.

Weasley.

“He’s not here,” said Mrs. Weasley angrily. “This is a

hospital wing, Minister, don’t you think you’d do

better to — ”

But the door opened, and Dumbledore came sweeping

up the ward.

“What has happened?” said Dumbledore sharply,

looking from Fudge to Professor McGonagall. “Why

are you disturbing these people? Minerva, I’m

surprised at you — I asked you to stand guard over

Barty Crouch — ”

“There is no need to stand guard over him anymore,

Dumbledore!” she shrieked. “The Minister has seen to

that!”

Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose

control like this. There were angry blotches of color in

her cheeks, and her hands were balled into fists; she

was trembling with fury.

 

“When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the

Death Eater responsible for tonight’s events,” said

Snape, in a low voice, “he seemed to feel his personal

safety was in question. He insisted on summoning a

dementor to accompany him into the castle. He

brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch — ”

“I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!”

Professor McGonagall fumed. “I told him you would

never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle,

but — ”

“My dear woman!” roared Fudge, who likewise looked

angrier than Harry had ever seen him, “as Minister of

Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring

protection with me when interviewing a possibly

dangerous — ”

But Professor McGonagall’s voice drowned Fudge’s.

“The moment that — that thing entered the room,”

she screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over,

“it swooped down on Crouch and — and — ”

Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor

McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what

had happened. He did not need her to finish her

sentence. He knew what the dementor must have

done. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty

Crouch. It had sucked his soul out through his

mouth. He was worse than dead.

“By all accounts, he is no loss!” blustered Fudge. “It

seems he has been responsible for several deaths!”

“But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said

Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as

though seeing him plainly for the first time. “He

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

cannot give evidence about why he killed those

people.”

“Why he killed them? Well, that’s no mystery, is it?”

blustered Fudge. “He was a raving lunatic! From what

Minerva and Severus have told me, he seems to have

thought he was doing it all on You-Know- Who’s

instructions!”

“Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions,

Cornelius,” Dumbledore said. “Those people’s deaths

were mere by-products of a plan to restore Voldemort

to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort

has been restored to his body.”

Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a

heavy weight into his face. Dazed and blinking, he

stared back at Dumbledore as if he couldn’t quite

believe what he had just heard. He began to sputter,

still goggling at Dumbledore.

“You-Know- Who ... returned? Preposterous. Come

now, Dumbledore ...”

“As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,”

said Dumbledore, “we heard Barry Crouch confess.

Under the influence of Veritaserum, he told us how

he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and how Voldemort

— learning of his continued existence from Bertha

Jorkins — went to free him from his father and used

him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you.

Crouch has helped Voldemort to return.”

“See here, Dumbledore,” said Fudge, and Harry was

astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face,

“you — you can’t seriously believe that. You-Know-

Who — back? Come now, come now . . . certainly,

Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon

 

You-Know- Who’s orders — but to take the word of a

lunatic like that, Dumbledore ...”

“When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he

was transported straight to Voldemort,” said

Dumbledore steadily. “He witnessed Lord Voldemort’s

rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you will step up to

my office.”

Dumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he

was awake, but shook his head and said, “I am afraid

I cannot permit you to question Harry tonight.”

Fudge’s curious smile lingered. He too glanced at

Harry, then looked back at Dumbledore, and said,

“You are — er — prepared to take Harry’s word on

this, are you, Dumbledore?”

There was a moment’s silence, which was broken by

Sirius growling. His hackles were raised, and he was

baring his teeth at Fudge.

“Certainly, I believe Harry,” said Dumbledore. His

eyes were blazing now. “I heard Crouch’s confession,

and I heard Harry’s account of what happened after

he touched the Triwizard Cup; the two stories make

sense, they explain everything that has happened

since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.”

Fudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once

again, he glanced at Harry before answering.

“You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has

returned, on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a

boy who ... well ...”

Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly

understood.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“You’ve been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,” he

said quietly.

Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped.

None of them had realized that Harry was awake.

Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate

look came over his face.

“And if I have?” he said, looking at Dumbledore. “If I

have discovered that you’ve been keeping certain facts

about the boy very quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And

having funny turns all over the place — ”

“I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry

has been experiencing in his scar?” said Dumbledore

coolly.

“You admit that he has been having these pains,

then?” said Fudge quickly. “Headaches? Nightmares?

Possibly — hallucinations?”

“Listen to me, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, taking a

step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to

radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry

had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young

Crouch. “Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon

his forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it

hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling

particularly murderous.”

Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore,

but he looked no less stubborn.

“You’ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I’ve never heard

of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before. ...”

“Look, I saw Voldemort come back!” Harry shouted.

He tried to get out of bed again, but Mrs. Weasley

 

forced him back. “I saw the Death Eaters! I can give

you their names! Lucius Malfoy — ”

Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry

looked at him, Snape’s eyes flew back to Fudge.

“Malfoy was cleared!” said Fudge, visibly affronted. “A

very old family — donations to excellent causes — ”

“Macnair!” Harry continued.

“Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!”

“Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle — ”

“You are merely repeating the names of those who

were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years

ago!” said Fudge angrily. “You could have found those

names in old reports of the trials! For heaven’s sake,

Dumbledore — the boy was full of some crackpot

story at the end of last year too — his tales are getting

taller, and you’re still swallowing them — the boy can

talk to snakes, Dumbledore, and you still think he’s

trustworthy?”

“You fool!” Professor McGonagall cried. “Cedric

Diggory! Mr. Crouch! These deaths were not the

random work of a lunatic!”

“I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge,

now matching her anger, his face purpling. “It seems

to me that you are all determined to start a panic that

will destabilize everything we have worked for these

last thirteen years!”

Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He had

always thought of Fudge as a kindly figure, a little

blustering, a little pompous, but essentially good-

natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before

 

him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of

disruption in his comfortable and ordered world — to

believe that Voldemort could have risen.

“Voldemort has returned,” Dumbledore repeated. “If

you accept that fact straightaway, Fudge, and take

the necessary measures, we may still be able to save

the situation. The first and most essential step is to

remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors — ”

“Preposterous!” shouted Fudge again. “Remove the

dementors? I’d be kicked out of office for suggesting

it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night

because we know the dementors are standing guard

at Azkaban!”

“The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds,

Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord

Voldemort ’s most dangerous supporters in the care of

creatures who will join him the instant he asks them!”

said Dumbledore. “They will not remain loyal to you,

Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope

for their powers and their pleasures than you can!

With the dementors behind him, and his old

supporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed

to stop him regaining the sort of power he had

thirteen years ago!”

Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though

no words could express his outrage.

“The second step you must take — and at once,”

Dumbledore pressed on, “is to send envoys to the

giants.”

“Envoys to the giants?” Fudge shrieked, finding his

tongue again. “What madness is this?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is

too late,” said Dumbledore, “or Voldemort will

persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among

wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!”

“You — you cannot be serious!” Fudge gasped,

shaking his head and retreating further from

Dumbledore. “If the magical community got wind that

I had approached the giants — people hate them,

Dumbledore — end of my career — ”

“You are blinded,” said Dumbledore, his voice rising

now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes

blazing once more, “by the love of the office you hold,

Cornelius! You place too much importance, and you

always have done, on the so-called purity of blood!

You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone

is born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor has

just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure-

blood family as old as any — and see what that man

chose to make of his life! I tell you now — take the

steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered,

in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest

Ministers of Magic we have ever known. Fail to act —

and history will remember you as the man who

stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance

to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!”

“Insane,” whispered Fudge, still backing away. “Mad

And then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was

standing frozen at the foot of Harry’s bed, her hands

over her mouth. Mrs. Weasley was still standing over

Harry, her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from

rising. Bill, Ron, and Hermione were staring at Fudge.

“If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you

as far as this, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, “we have

 

reached a parting of the ways. You must act as you

see fit. And I — I shall act as I see fit.”

Dumbledore ’s voice carried no hint of a threat; it

sounded like a mere statement, but Fudge bristled as

though Dumbledore were advancing upon him with a

wand.

“Now, see here, Dumbledore,” he said, waving a

threatening finger. “I’ve given you free rein, always.

I’ve had a lot of respect for you. I might not have

agreed with some of your decisions, but I’ve kept

quiet. There aren’t many who’d have let you hire

werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach

your students without reference to the Ministry. But if

you’re going to work against me — ”

“The only one against whom I intend to work,” said

Dumbledore, “is Lord Voldemort. If you are against

him, then we remain, Cornelius, on the same side.”

It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He

rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a

moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands.

Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his voice, “He

can’t be back, Dumbledore, he just can’t be ...”

Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up

the left sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out

his forearm and showed it to Fudge, who recoiled.

“There,” said Snape harshly. “There. The Dark Mark.

It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it

burned black, but you can still see it. Every Death

Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord.

It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his

means of summoning us to him. When he touched

the Mark of any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate,

and Apparate, instantly, at his side. This Mark has

 

been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff’s too. Why do

you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the

Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff

fears the Dark Lord’s vengeance. He betrayed too

many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a

welcome back into the fold.”

Fudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking

his head. He did not seem to have taken in a word

Snape had said. He stared, apparently repelled by the

ugly mark on Snape ’s arm, then looked up at

Dumbledore and whispered, “I don’t know what you

and your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have

heard enough. I have no more to add. I will be in

touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the

running of this school. I must return to the Ministry.”

He had almost reached the door when he paused. He

turned around, strode back down the dormitory, and

stopped at Harry’s bed.

“Your winnings,” he said shortly, taking a large bag of

gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto Harry’s

bedside table. “One thousand Galleons. There should

have been a presentation ceremony, but under the

circumstances ...”

He crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked

out of the room, slamming the door behind him. The

moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to

look at the group around Harry’s bed.

“There is work to be done,” he said. “Molly ... am I

right in thinking that I can count on you and

Arthur?”

“Of course you can,” said Mrs. Weasley. She was

white to the lips, but she looked resolute. “We know

what Fudge is. It’s Arthur’s fondness for Muggles that

 

has held him back at the Ministry all these years.

Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride.”

“Then I need to send a message to Arthur,” said

Dumbledore. “All those that we can persuade of the

truth must be notified immediately, and he is well

placed to contact those at the Ministry who are not as

shortsighted as Cornelius.”

“Ill go to Dad,” said Bill, standing up. “Ill go now.”

“Excellent,” said Dumbledore. “Tell him what has

happened. Tell him I will be in direct contact with him

shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge

thinks I am interfering at the Ministry — ”

“Leave it to me,” said Bill.

He clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, kissed his

mother on the cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode

quickly from the room.

“Minerva,” said Dumbledore, turning to Professor

McGonagall, “I want to see Hagrid in my office as

soon as possible. Also — if she will consent to come —

Madame Maxime.”

Professor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.

“Poppy,” Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, “would

you be very kind and go down to Professor Moody’s

office, where I think you will find a house-elf called

Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for

her, and take her back to the kitchens. I think Dobby

will look after her for us.”

“Very — very well,” said Madam Pomfrey, looking

startled, and she too left.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Dumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and

that Madam Pomfrey’s footsteps had died away,

before he spoke again.

“And now,” he said, “it is time for two of our number

to recognize each other for what they are. Sirius ... if

you could resume your usual form.”

The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then,

in an instant, turned back into a man.

Mrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.

“Sirius Black!” she shrieked, pointing at him.

“Mum, shut up!” Ron yelled. “It’s okay!”

Snape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the

look on his face was one of mingled fury and horror.

“Him!” he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face

showed equal dislike. “What is he doing here?”

“He is here at my invitation,” said Dumbledore,

looking between them, “as are you, Severus. I trust

you both. It is time for you to lay aside your old

differences and trust each other.”

Harry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near

miracle. Sirius and Snape were eyeing each other

with the utmost loathing.

“I will settle, in the short term,” said Dumbledore,

with a bite of impatience in his voice, “for a lack of

open hostility. You will shake hands. You are on the

same side now. Time is short, and unless the few of

us who know the truth do not stand united, there is

no hope for any of us.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Very slowly — but still glaring at each other as

though each wished the other nothing but ill — Sirius

and Snape moved toward each other and shook

hands. They let go extremely quickly.

“That will do to be going on with,” said Dumbledore,

stepping between them once more. “Now I have work

for each of you. Fudge’s attitude, though not

unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to

set off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella

Figg, Mundungus Fletcher — the old crowd. Lie low at

Lupins for a while; I will contact you there.”

“But — ” said Harry.

He wanted Sirius to stay. He did not want to have to

say goodbye again so quickly.

“You’ll see me very soon, Harry,” said Sirius, turning

to him. “I promise you. But I must do what I can, you

understand, don’t you?”

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah ... of course I do.”

Sirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to

Dumbledore, transformed again into the black dog,

and ran the length of the room to the door, whose

handle he turned with a paw. Then he was gone.

“Severus,” said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, “you

know what I must ask you to do. If you are ready ... if

you are prepared ...”

“I am,” said Snape.

He looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold,

black eyes glittered strangely.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Then good luck,” said Dumbledore, and he watched,

with a trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape

swept wordlessly after Sirius.

It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke

again.

“I must go downstairs,” he said finally. “I must see the

Diggorys. Harry — take the rest of your potion. I will

see all of you later.”

Harry slumped back against his pillows as

Dumbledore disappeared. Hermione, Ron, and Mrs.

Weasley were all looking at him. None of them spoke

for a very long time.

“You’ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry,”

Mrs. Weasley said at last. Her hand nudged the sack

of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the

bottle and the goblet. “You have a good long sleep. Try

and think about something else for a while . . . think

about what you’re going to buy with your winnings!”

“I don’t want that gold,” said Harry in an

expressionless voice. “You have it. Anyone can have

it. I shouldn’t have won it. It should’ve been Cedric’s.”

The thing against which he had been fighting on and

off ever since he had come out of the maze was

threatening to overpower him. He could feel a

burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners of his

eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.

“It wasn’t your fault, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley whispered.

“I told him to take the cup with me,” said Harry.

Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He

wished Ron would look away.

 

Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside

cabinet, bent down, and put her arms around Harry.

He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as

though by a mother. The full weight of everything he

had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as

Mrs. Weasley held him to her. His mother’s face, his

father’s voice, the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground

all started spinning in his head until he could hardly

bear it, until he was screwing up his face against the

howl of misery fighting to get out of him.

There was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley

and Harry broke apart. Hermione was standing by the

window. She was holding something tight in her

hand.

“Sorry,” she whispered.

“Your potion, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley quickly,

wiping her eyes on the back of her hand.

Harry drank it in one gulp. The effect was

instantaneous. Heavy, irresistible waves of dreamless

sleep broke over him; he fell back onto his pillows and

thought no more.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

THE BEGINNING

When he looked back, even a month later, Harry

found he had only scattered memories of the next few

days. It was as though he had been through too much

to take in any more. The recollections he did have

were very painful. The worst, perhaps, was the

meeting with the Diggorys that took place the

following morning.

They did not blame him for what had happened; on

the contrary, both thanked him for returning Cedric’s

body to them. Mr. Diggory sobbed through most of

the interview. Mrs. Diggory ’s grief seemed to be

beyond tears.

“He suffered very little then,” she said, when Harry

had told her how Cedric had died. “And after all,

Amos ... he died just when he’d won the tournament.

He must have been happy.”

When they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry

and said, “You look after yourself, now.”

 

Harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.

“You take this,” he muttered to her. “It should’ve been

Cedric’s, he got there first, you take it — ”

But she backed away from him.

“Oh no, it’s yours, dear, I couldn’t ... you keep it.”

Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following

evening. From what Hermione and Ron told him,

Dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning

at breakfast. He had merely requested that they leave

Harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger

him to tell the story of what had happened in the

maze. Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in

the corridors, avoiding his eyes. Some whispered

behind their hands as he passed. He guessed that

many of them had believed Rita Skeeter’s article

about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was.

Perhaps they were formulating their own theories

about how Cedric had died. He found he didn’t care

very much. He liked it best when he was with Ron

and Hermione and they were talking about other

things, or else letting him sit in silence while they

played chess. He felt as though all three of them had

reached an understanding they didn’t need to put

into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some

word, of what was going on outside Hogwarts — and

that it was useless to speculate about what might be

coming until they knew anything for certain. The only

time they touched upon the subject was when Ron

told Harry about a meeting Mrs. Weasley had had

with Dumbledore before going home.

“She went to ask him if you could come straight to us

this summer,” he said. “But he wants you to go back

to the Dursleys, at least at first.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Why?” said Harry.

“She said Dumbledore’s got his reasons,” said Ron,

shaking his head darkly. “I suppose we’ve got to trust

him, haven’t we?”

The only person apart from Ron and Hermione that

Harry felt able to talk to was Hagrid. As there was no

longer a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, they

had those lessons free. They used the one on

Thursday afternoon to go down and visit Hagrid in his

cabin. It was a bright and sunny day; Fang bounded

out of the open door as they approached, barking and

wagging his tail madly.

“Who’s that?” called Hagrid, coming to the door.

“ Harry\”

He strode out to meet them, pulled Harry into a one-

armed hug, ruffled his hair, and said, “Good ter see

yeh, mate. Good ter see yeh.”

They saw two bucket-size cups and saucers on the

wooden table in front of the fireplace when they

entered Hagrid ’s cabin.

“Bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe,” Hagrid said. “She’s

jus’ left.”

“Who?” said Ron curiously.

“Madame Maxime, o’ course!” said Hagrid.

“You two made up, have you?” said Ron.

“Dunno what yeh’re talkin’ about,” said Hagrid airily,

fetching more cups from the dresser. When he had

made tea and offered around a plate of doughy

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

cookies, he leaned back in his chair and surveyed

Harry closely through his beetle-black eyes.

“You all righ’?” he said gruffly.

“Yeah,” said Harry.

“No, yeh’re not,” said Hagrid. “ ’Course yeh’re not. But

yeh will be.”

Harry said nothing.

“Knew he was goin’ ter come back,” said Hagrid, and

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up at him, shocked.

“Known it fer years, Harry. Knew he was out there,

bidin’ his time. It had ter happen. Well, now it has,

an’ we’ll jus’ have ter get on with it. We’ll fight. Migh’

be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold. That’s

Dumbledore’s plan, anyway. Great man, Dumbledore.

’S long as we’ve got him, I’m not too worried.”

Hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving

expressions on their faces.

“No good sittin’ worryin’ abou’ it,” he said. “What’s

cornin’ will come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does.

Dumbledore told me wha’ you did, Harry.”

Hagrid’s chest swelled as he looked at Harry.

“Yeh did as much as yer father would’ve done, an’ I

can’ give yeh no higher praise than that.”

Harry smiled back at him. It was the first time he’d

smiled in days. “What’s Dumbledore asked you to do,

Hagrid?” he asked. “He sent Professor McGonagall to

ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him — that

night.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Got a little job fer me over the summer,” said Hagrid.

“Secret, though. I’m not s’pposed ter talk abou’ it, no,

not even ter you lot. Olympe — Madame Maxime ter

you — might be cornin’ with me. I think she will.

Think I got her persuaded.”

“Is it to do with Voldemort?”

Hagrid flinched at the sound of the name.

“Migh’ be,” he said evasively. “Now ... who’d like ter

come an’ visit the las’ skrewt with me? I was jokin’ —

jokin’!” he added hastily, seeing the looks on their

faces.

k k k

It was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk

up in the dormitory on the night before his return to

Privet Drive. He was dreading the Leaving Feast,

which was usually a cause for celebration, when the

winner of the Inter-House Championship would be

announced. He had avoided being in the Great Hall

when it was full ever since he had left the hospital

wing, preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to

avoid the stares of his fellow students.

When he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they

saw at once that the usual decorations were missing.

The Great Hall was normally decorated with the

winning House’s colors for the Leaving Feast. Tonight,

however, there were black drapes on the wall behind

the teachers’ table. Harry knew instantly that they

were there as a mark of respect to Cedric.

The real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now,

his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place. He

was extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

spoke to him. Harry couldn’t blame him; Moody’s fear

of attack was bound to have been increased by his

ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk. Professor

Karkaroff’s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he

sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff

was now, and whether Voldemort had caught up with

him.

Madame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next

to Hagrid. They were talking quietly together. Further

along the table, sitting next to Professor McGonagall,

was Snape. His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment

as Harry looked at him. His expression was difficult to

read. He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever.

Harry continued to watch him, long after Snape had

looked away.

What was it that Snape had done on Dumbledore’s

orders, the night that Voldemort had returned? And

why ... why ... was Dumbledore so convinced that

Snape was truly on their side? He had been their spy,

Dumbledore had said so in the Pensieve. Snape had

turned spy against Voldemort, “at great personal

risk.” Was that the job he had taken up again? Had

he made contact with the Death Eaters, perhaps?

Pretended that he had never really gone over to

Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort

himself, biding his time?

Harry’s musings were ended by Professor

Dumbledore, who stood up at the staff table. The

Great Hall, which in any case had been less noisy

than it usually was at the Leaving Feast, became very

quiet.

“The end,” said Dumbledore, looking around at them

all, “of another year.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

He paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff

table. Theirs had been the most subdued table before

he had gotten to his feet, and theirs were still the

saddest and palest faces in the Hall.

“There is much that I would like to say to you all

tonight,” said Dumbledore, “but I must first

acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who

should be sitting here,” he gestured toward the

Hufflepuffs, “enjoying our feast with us. I would like

you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to

Cedric Diggory.”

They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as

everyone in the Hall stood, and raised their goblets,

and echoed, in one loud, low, rumbling voice, “Cedric

Diggory.”

Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd.

There were tears pouring silently down her face. He

looked down at the table as they all sat down again.

“Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the

qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff house,”

Dumbledore continued. “He was a good and loyal

friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. His death

has affected you all, whether you knew him well or

not. I think that you have the right, therefore, to

know exactly how it came about.”

Harry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.

“Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.”

A panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were

staring at Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror. He

looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter

themselves into silence.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“The Ministry of Magic,” Dumbledore continued, “does

not wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of

your parents will be horrified that I have done so —

either because they will not believe that Lord

Voldemort has returned, or because they think I

should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my

belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable

to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric

died as the result of an accident, or some sort of

blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.”

Stunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was

turned toward Dumbledore now ... or almost every

face. Over at the Slytherin table, Harry saw Draco

Malfoy muttering something to Crabbe and Goyle.

Harry felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in his stomach.

He forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.

“There is somebody else who must be mentioned in

connection with Cedric’s death,” Dumbledore went

on. “I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.”

A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads

turned in Harry’s direction before flicking back to face

Dumbledore.

“Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,”

said Dumbledore. “He risked his own life to return

Cedric’s body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every

respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever

shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honor

him.”

Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his

goblet once more. Nearly everyone in the Great Hall

followed suit. They murmured his name, as they had

murmured Cedric’s, and drank to him. But through a

gap in the standing figures, Harry saw that Malfoy,

Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had

 

remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets

untouched. Dumbledore, who after all possessed no

magical eye, did not see them.

When everyone had once again resumed their seats,

Dumbledore continued, “The Triwizard Tournament’s

aim was to further and promote magical

understanding. In the light of what has happened —

of Lord Voldemort’s return — such ties are more

important than ever before.”

Dumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and

Hagrid, to Fleur Delacour and her fellow Beauxbatons

students, to Viktor Krum and the Durmstrangs at the

Slytherin table. Krum, Harry saw, looked wary,

almost frightened, as though he expected Dumbledore

to say something harsh.

“Every guest in this Hall,” said Dumbledore, and his

eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, “will be

welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to

come. I say to you all, once again — in the light of

Lord Voldemort’s return, we are only as strong as we

are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord

Voldemort’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is

very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally

strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of

habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are

identical and our hearts are open.

“It is my belief — and never have I so hoped that I am

mistaken — that we are all facing dark and difficult

times. Some of you in this Hall have already suffered

directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort. Many of your

families have been torn asunder. A week ago, a

student was taken from our midst.

“Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should

come when you have to make a choice between what

 

is right and what is easy, remember what happened

to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because

he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort.

Remember Cedric Diggory.”

Harry’s trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her

cage on top of it. He, Ron, and Hermione were waiting

in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the

fourth years for the carriages that would take them

back to Hogsmeade station. It was another beautiful

summer’s day. He supposed that Privet Drive would

be hot and leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when

he arrived there that evening. The thought gave him

no pleasure at all.

“ ’Arry!”

He looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up

the stone steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across

the grounds, Harry could see Hagrid helping Madame

Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their

harness. The Beauxbatons carriage was about to take

off.

“We will see each uzzer again, I ’ope,” said Fleur as

she reached him, holding out her hand. “I am ’oping

to get a job ’ere, to improve my Eenglish.”

“It’s very good already,” said Ron in a strangled sort of

voice. Fleur smiled at him; Hermione scowled.

“Good-bye, ’Arry,” said Fleur, turning to go. “It ’az

been a pleasure meeting you!”

Harry’s spirits couldn’t help but lift slightly as he

watched Fleur hurry back across the lawns to

Madame Maxime, her silvery hair rippling in the

sunlight.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting

back,” said Ron. “D’you reckon they can steer that

ship without Karkaroff?”

“Karkaroff did not steer,” said a gruff voice. “He

stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork.”

Krum had come to say good-bye to Hermione.

“Could I have a vord?” he asked her.

“Oh ... yes ... all right,” said Hermione, looking

slightly flustered, and following Krum through the

crowd and out of sight.

“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her.

“The carriages’ll be here in a minute!”

He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however,

and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over

the crowd to try and see what Krum and Hermione

might be up to. They returned quite soon. Ron stared

at Hermione, but her face was quite impassive.

“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He

vos alvays polite to me. Alvays. Even though I vos

from Durmstrang — with Karkaroff,” he added,

scowling.

“Have you got a new headmaster yet?” said Harry.

Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had

done, shook Harry’s hand, and then Ron’s. Ron

looked as though he was suffering some sort of

painful internal struggle. Krum had already started

walking away when Ron burst out, “Can I have your

autograph?”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless

carriages that were now trundling toward them up the

drive, as Krum, looking surprised but gratified, signed

a fragment of parchment for Ron.

The weather could not have been more different on

the journey back to King’s Cross than it had been on

their way to Hogwarts the previous September. There

wasn’t a single cloud in the sky. Harry, Ron, and

Hermione had managed to get a compartment to

themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under

Ron’s dress robes to stop him from hooting

continually; Hedwig was dozing, her head under her

wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat

like a large, furry ginger cushion. Harry, Ron, and

Hermione talked more fully and freely than they had

all week as the train sped them southward. Harry felt

as though Dumbledore’s speech at the Leaving Feast

had unblocked him, somehow. It was less painful to

discuss what had happened now. They broke off their

conversation about what action Dumbledore might be

taking, even now, to stop Voldemort only when the

lunch trolley arrived.

When Hermione returned from the trolley and put her

money back into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy

of the Daily Prophet that she had been carrying in

there. Harry looked at it, unsure whether he really

wanted to know what it might say, but Hermione,

seeing him looking at it, said calmly, “There’s nothing

in there. You can look for yourself, but there’s

nothing at all. I’ve been checking every day. Just a

small piece the day after the third task saying you

won the tournament. They didn’t even mention

Cedric. Nothing about any of it. If you ask me, Fudge

is forcing them to keep quiet.”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“He’ll never keep Rita quiet,” said Harry. “Not on a

story like this.”

“Oh, Rita hasn’t written anything at all since the third

task,” said Hermione in an oddly constrained voice.

“As a matter of fact,” she added, her voice now

trembling slightly, “Rita Skeeter isn’t going to be

writing anything at all for a while. Not unless she

wants me to spill the beans on her.”

“What are you talking about?” said Ron.

“I found out how she was listening in on private

conversations when she wasn’t supposed to be

coming onto the grounds,” said Hermione in a rush.

Harry had the impression that Hermione had been

dying to tell them this for days, but that she had

restrained herself in light of everything else that had

happened.

“How was she doing it?” said Harry at once.

“How did you find out?” said Ron, staring at her.

“Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea,

Harry,” she said.

“Did I?” said Harry, perplexed. “How?”

“Bugging,” said Hermione happily.

“But you said they didn’t work — ”

“Oh not electronic bugs,” said Hermione. “No, you see

... Rita Skeeter” — Hermione ’s voice trembled with

quiet triumph — “is an unregistered Animagus. She

can turn — ”

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

Hermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out of her

bag.

“ — into a beetle.”

“You’re kidding,” said Ron. “You haven’t ... she’s not

“Oh yes she is,” said Hermione happily, brandishing

the jar at them.

Inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat

beetle.

“That’s never — you’re kidding — ” Ron whispered,

lifting the jar to his eyes.

“No, I’m not,” said Hermione, beaming. “I caught her

on the windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very

closely, and you 11 notice the markings around her

antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she

wears.”

Harry looked and saw that she was quite right. He

also remembered something.

“There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard

Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum!”

“Exactly,” said Hermione. “And Viktor pulled a beetle

out of my hair after we’d had our conversation by the

lake. And unless I’m very much mistaken, Rita was

perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the

day your scar hurt. She’s been buzzing around for

stories all year.”

“When we saw Malfoy under that tree ...” said Ron

slowly.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“He was talking to her, in his hand,” said Hermione.

“He knew, of course. That’s how she’s been getting all

those nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They

wouldn’t care that she was doing something illegal, as

long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us

and Hagrid.”

Hermione took the glass jar back from Ron and

smiled at the beetle, which buzzed angrily against the

glass.

“I’ve told her I’ll let her out when we get back to

London,” said Hermione. “I’ve put an Unbreakable

Charm on the jar, you see, so she can’t transform.

And I’ve told her she’s to keep her quill to herself for a

whole year. See if she can’t break the habit of writing

horrible lies about people.”

Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back

inside her schoolbag.

The door of the compartment slid open.

“Very clever, Granger,” said Draco Malfoy.

Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All

three of them looked more pleased with themselves,

more arrogant and more menacing, than Harry had

ever seen them.

“So,” said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the

compartment and looking slowly around at them, a

smirk quivering on his lips. “You caught some

pathetic reporter, and Potter’s Dumbledore’s favorite

boy again. Big deal.”

His smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Trying not to think about it, are we?” said Malfoy

softly, looking around at all three of them. “Trying to

pretend it hasn’t happened?”

“Get out,” said Harry.

He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had

watched him muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during

Dumbledore’s speech about Cedric. He could feel a

kind of ringing in his ears. His hand gripped his wand

under his robes.

“You’ve picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I

told you you ought to choose your company more

carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first

day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with

riffraff like this!” He jerked his head at Ron and

Hermione. “Too late now, Potter! They’ll be the first to

go, now the Dark Lord’s back! Mudbloods and

Muggle-lovers first! Well — second — Diggory was the

f— ”

It was as though someone had exploded a box of

fireworks within the compartment. Blinded by the

blaze of the spells that had blasted from every

direction, deafened by a series of bangs, Harry

blinked and looked down at the floor.

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious

in the doorway. He, Ron, and Hermione were on their

feet, all three of them having used a different hex. Nor

were they the only ones to have done so.

“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said

Fred matter-of-factly, stepping onto Goyle and into

the compartment. He had his wand out, and so did

George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he

followed Fred inside.

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

“Interesting effect,” said George, looking down at

Crabbe. “Who used the Furnunculus Curse?”

“Me,” said Harry.

“Odd,” said George lightly. “I used Jelly-Legs. Looks

as though those two shouldn’t be mixed. He seems to

have sprouted little tentacles all over his face. Well,

let’s not leave them here, they don’t add much to the

decor.”

Ron, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed

the unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle — each of

whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of

jinxes with which they had been hit — out into the

corridor, then came back into the compartment and

rolled the door shut.

“Exploding Snap, anyone?” said Fred, pulling out a

pack of cards.

They were halfway through their fifth game when

Harry decided to ask them.

“You going to tell us, then?” he said to George. “Who

you were blackmailing?”

“Oh,” said George darkly. “ That

“It doesn’t matter,” said Fred, shaking his head

impatiently. “It wasn’t anything important. Not now,

anyway.”

“We’ve given up,” said George, shrugging.

But Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and

finally, Fred said, “All right, all right, if you really

want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman.”

“Bagman?” said Harry sharply. “Are you saying he

was involved in — ”

“Nah,” said George gloomily. “Nothing like that.

Stupid git. He wouldn’t have the brains.”

“Well, what, then?” said Ron.

Fred hesitated, then said, “You remember that bet we

had with him at the Quidditch World Cup? About how

Ireland would win, but Krum would get the Snitch?”

“Yeah,” said Harry and Ron slowly.

“Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he’d caught

from the Irish mascots.”

“So?”

“So,” said Fred impatiently, “it vanished, didn’t it? By

next morning, it had gone!”

“But — it must’ve been an accident, mustn’t it?” said

Hermione.

George laughed very bitterly.

“Yeah, that’s what we thought, at first. We thought if

we just wrote to him, and told him he’d made a

mistake, he’d cough up. But nothing doing. Ignored

our letter. We kept trying to talk to him about it at

Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse to

get away from us.”

“In the end, he turned pretty nasty,” said Fred. “Told

us we were too young to gamble, and he wasn’t giving

us anything.”

“So we asked for our money back,” said George

glowering.

“He didn’t refuse!” gasped Hermione.

“Right in one,” said Fred.

“But that was all your savings!” said Ron.

“Tell me about it,” said George. “ ’Course, we found

out what was going on in the end. Lee Jordan’s dad

had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as

well. Turns out he’s in big trouble with the goblins.

Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them

cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and

took all the gold he had, and it still wasn’t enough to

cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to

Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He’s lost everything

gambling. Hasn’t got two Galleons to rub together.

And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins

back?”

“How?” said Harry.

“He put a bet on you, mate,” said Fred. “Put a big bet

on you to win the tournament. Bet against the

goblins.”

“So that’s why he kept trying to help me win!” said

Harry. “Well — I did win, didn’t I? So he can pay you

your gold!”

“Nope,” said George, shaking his head. “The goblins

play as dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory,

and Bagman was betting you’d win outright. So

Bagman had to run for it. He did run for it right after

the third task.”

George sighed deeply and started dealing out the

cards again.

The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough;

Harry wished it could have gone on all summer, in

fact, and that he would never arrive at King’s Cross . . .

but as he had learned the hard way that year, time

will not slow down when something unpleasant lies

ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was

pulling in at platform nine and three-quarters. The

usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the

students began to disembark. Ron and Hermione

struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,

carrying their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.

“Fred — George — wait a moment.”

The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and

drew out his Triwizard winnings.

“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into

George’s hands.

“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted.

“Take it,” Harry repeated firmly. “I don’t want it.”

“You’re mental,” said George, trying to push it back at

Harry.

“No, I’m not,” said Harry. “You take it, and get

inventing. It’s for the joke shop.”

“He is mental,” Fred said in an almost awed voice.

“Listen,” said Harry firmly. “If you don’t take it, I’m

throwing it down the drain. I don’t want it and I don’t

need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all

 

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - J.K. Rowling

do with a few laughs. I’ve got a feeling we’re going to

need them more than usual before long.”

“Harry,” said George weakly, weighing the money bag

in his hands, “there’s got to be a thousand Galleons

in here.”

“Yeah,” said Harry, grinning. “Think how many

Canary Creams that is.”

The twins stared at him.

“Just don’t tell your mum where you got it ...

although she might not be so keen for you to join the

Ministry anymore, come to think of it. ...”

“Harry,” Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand.

“Look,” he said flatly, “take it, or I’ll hex you. I know

some good ones now. Just do me one favor, okay?

Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they’re

from you.”

He left the compartment before they could say

another word, stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe, and

Goyle, who were still lying on the floor, covered in hex

marks.

Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs.

Weasley was close by him. She hugged Harry very

tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear, “I

think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the

summer. Keep in touch, Harry.”

“See you, Harry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back.

“ ’Bye, Harry!” said Hermione, and she did something

she had never done before, and kissed him on the

cheek.

 

“Harry — thanks,” George muttered, while Fred

nodded fervently at his side.

Harry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and

followed him silently from the station. There was no

point worrying yet, he told himself, as he got into the

back of the Dursleys’ car.

As Hagrid had said, what would come, would come...

and he would have to meet it when it did.
